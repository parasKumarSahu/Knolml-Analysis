					The &#x27;&#x27;&#x27;Westchester Tornado&#x27;&#x27;&#x27; was an unusual [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F2]] [[tornado]] that touched down in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland New York]] on [[Tornadoes_of_2006#July_11-12|July 12, 2006]]. The tornado tracked for 13&amp;nbsp;[[mile|miles]] (20.9&amp;nbsp;[[kilometre|km]]) into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33&amp;nbsp;minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]]. It tracked 3&amp;nbsp;mi (4.8&amp;nbsp;km) across the river before moving back over land. Coming ashore, the tornado struck the town [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at F1 intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter mile in diameter. The tornado continued through the county causing damage to numerous structures along the way until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01 p.m. EDT (20:01 UTC). Not long after entering the state, it lifted near the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03 p.m. EDT (20:03 UTC).

					==Meteorological synopsis==
					On July 12, a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]].

					The &#x27;&#x27;&#x27;Westchester Tornado&#x27;&#x27;&#x27; was an unusual [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F2]] [[tornado]] that touched down in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland New York]] on [[Tornadoes_of_2006#July_11-12|July 12, 2006]]. The tornado tracked for 13&amp;nbsp;[[mile|miles]] (20.9&amp;nbsp;[[kilometre|km]]) into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33&amp;nbsp;minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]]. It tracked 3&amp;nbsp;mi (4.8&amp;nbsp;km) across the river before moving back over land. Coming ashore, the tornado struck the town [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at F1 intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter mile in diameter. The tornado continued through the county causing damage to numerous structures along the way until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01 p.m. EDT (20:01 UTC). Not long after entering the state, it lifted near the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03 p.m. EDT (20:03 UTC).

					==Meteorological synopsis==
					On July 12, a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] was issued at 12:40 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornadowatch&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=[[2006-07-12]]| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; At around 1:05 p.m. EDT (17:05 UTC), a thunderstorm produced winds up to 60&amp;nbsp;[[miles per hour|mph]] (95&amp;nbsp;[[kilometres per hour|km/h]]) in [[Warren County, New Jersey|Warren County]], which snapped tree limbs and damaged power lines.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tstmwind&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625642 (Thunderstorm Wind)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625642}}&lt;/ref&gt; A stronger thunderstorm developed around 2 p.m. EDT (18:00 UTC) and produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45 p.m. EDT (18:45 UTC), no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;NJFunnel&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm became stronger and developed into a supercell thunderstorm as it crossed into [[New York]].

					==Impact==
					[[Image:DCP 7760.JPG|thumb|right|Tornado damage near a forested area]]
					The tornado took a clear path through [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]], [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]], and [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield]] counties, downing or uprooting thousands of trees, and damaging several structures, including significant structural damage to the California Closest Warehouse. Six minor injuries were also reported due to the tornado.

					Minor damage was reported in Rockland County. Only one structure, a dock, and one boat were damaged by the tornado.&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt;

					After crossing the [[Hudson River]], the tornado entered Westchester County, where the worst of the damage took place. The tornado first struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]], damaging roofs and tearing the siding off of numerous homes and businesses. Afterwards, the town of [[Pocantico Hills, New York|Pocantico Hills]] was struck as the tornado intensified to F2 intensity. Several trees were uprooted and two barns were destroyed. The California Closet Warehouse suffered severe structural damage, having two two-story concrete wall being destroyed. Moving to the east-northeast, the tornado struck the towns of [[Mount Pleasant, New York|Mount Pleasant]] and [[Hawthorne, New York|Hawthorne]], damaging numerous trees and causing minor structural damage.

It tracked 3&amp;nbsp;mi (4.8&amp;nbsp;km) across the river before moving back over land. Coming ashore, the tornado struck the town [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at F1 intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter mile in diameter. The tornado continued through the county causing damage to numerous structures along the way until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01 p.m. EDT (20:01 UTC). Not long after entering the state, it lifted near the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03 p.m. EDT (20:03 UTC).

					The tornado left considerable damage in its wake. Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, a large stained-glass window was completely shattered.

					The &#x27;&#x27;&#x27;Westchester Tornado&#x27;&#x27;&#x27; was an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F2]] [[tornado]] that touched down in [[Rockland County, New York]] on [[Tornadoes_of_2006#July_11-12|July 12, 2006]]. The tornado tracked for 13&amp;nbsp;miles (20.9&amp;nbsp;km) into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33&amp;nbsp;minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]]. It tracked 3&amp;nbsp;mi (4.8&amp;nbsp;km) across the river before moving back over land. Coming ashore, the tornado struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at F1 intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter mile in diameter,&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; making it both the strongest and largest tornado in the county.&lt;ref name=&quot;THPWest&quot;/&gt; The tornado continued through the county causing damage to numerous structures along the way until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01 p.m. EDT (20:01 UTC). Not long after entering the state, it lifted near the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03 p.m. EDT (20:03 UTC).&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name=&quot;THPWest&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=July 12, Weather Event #626587 (Tornado)| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

					==Meteorological synopsis==
					On July 12, a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornadowatch&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=2006-07-12| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; At around 1:05 p.m. EDT (17:05 UTC), a thunderstorm produced winds up to 60&amp;nbsp;[[miles per hour|mph]] (95&amp;nbsp;[[kilometres per hour|km/h]]) in [[Warren County, New Jersey|Warren County]], which snapped tree limbs and damaged power lines.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tstmwind&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625642 (Thunderstorm Wind)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625642}}&lt;/ref&gt; A stronger thunderstorm developed around 2 p.m. EDT (18:00 UTC) and produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45 p.m. EDT (18:45 UTC), no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;NJFunnel&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm became stronger and developed into a supercell thunderstorm as it crossed into [[New York]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornado1&quot;/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15 p.m. (21:15 UTC).&lt;ref name=&quot;WCBS&quot;/&gt; At around 3:30 p.m. EDT (19:30 UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100&amp;nbsp;yard (91&amp;nbsp;m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a 3&amp;nbsp;miles (4.8&amp;nbsp;km) path across the river. The tornado passed near the [[Tappan Zee Bridge]] before crossing into [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornado1&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #626587 (Tornado)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~626587}}&lt;/ref&gt;

					The &#x27;&#x27;&#x27;Westchester Tornado&#x27;&#x27;&#x27; was an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F2]] [[tornado]] that touched down in [[Rockland County, New York]] on [[Tornadoes_of_2006#July_11-12|July 12, 2006]]. The tornado tracked for 13&amp;nbsp;miles (20.9&amp;nbsp;km) into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33&amp;nbsp;minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]]. It tracked 3&amp;nbsp;mi (4.8&amp;nbsp;km) across the river before moving back over land. Coming ashore, the tornado struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at F1 intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter mile in diameter,&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; making it both the strongest and largest tornado in the county.&lt;ref name=&quot;THPWest&quot;/&gt; The tornado continued through the county causing damage to numerous structures along the way until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01 p.m. EDT (20:01 UTC). Not long after entering the state, it lifted near the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03 p.m. EDT (20:03 UTC).&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name=&quot;THPWest&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950-2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

					==Meteorological synopsis==
					On July 12, a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornadowatch&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=2006-07-12| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; At around 1:05 p.m. EDT (17:05 UTC), a thunderstorm produced winds up to 60&amp;nbsp;[[miles per hour|mph]] (95&amp;nbsp;[[kilometres per hour|km/h]]) in [[Warren County, New Jersey|Warren County]], which snapped tree limbs and damaged power lines.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tstmwind&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625642 (Thunderstorm Wind)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625642}}&lt;/ref&gt; A stronger thunderstorm developed around 2 p.m. EDT (18:00 UTC) and produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45 p.m. EDT (18:45 UTC), no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;NJFunnel&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm became stronger and developed into a supercell thunderstorm as it crossed into [[New York]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornado1&quot;/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15 p.m. (21:15 UTC).&lt;ref name=&quot;WCBS&quot;/&gt; At around 3:30 p.m. EDT (19:30 UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100&amp;nbsp;yard (91&amp;nbsp;m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a 3&amp;nbsp;miles (4.8&amp;nbsp;km) path across the river.

					The &#x27;&#x27;&#x27;Westchester Tornado&#x27;&#x27;&#x27; was an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F2]] [[tornado]] that touched down in [[Rockland County, New York]] on |July 12, 2006 which traveled 13&amp;nbsp;miles (20.9&amp;nbsp;km) into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33&amp;nbsp;minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling 3&amp;nbsp;mi (4.8&amp;nbsp;km) across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at F1 intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter mile (402&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter,&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; making it both the strongest and largest tornado in the county&#x27;s history.&lt;ref name=&quot;THPWest&quot;/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, causing damage to numerous structures along the way until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01 p.m. EDT (20:01 UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated near the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03 p.m. EDT (20:03 UTC).&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name=&quot;THPWest&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950-2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

					The tornado left significant damage in its wake. Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, and a large stained-glass window was shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted. There were no fatalities and only six minor injuries were associated with the storm. Damages from the tornado totaled $12.1&amp;nbsp;million (2006 [[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9&amp;nbsp;million 2008 USD). 

					==Meteorological synopsis==
					On July 12, a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornadowatch&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=2006-07-12| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; At around 1:05 p.m. EDT (17:05 UTC), a thunderstorm produced winds up to 60&amp;nbsp;[[miles per hour|mph]] (95&amp;nbsp;[[kilometres per hour|km/h]]) in [[Warren County, New Jersey|Warren County]], which snapped tree limbs and damaged power lines.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tstmwind&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625642 (Thunderstorm Wind)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625642}}&lt;/ref&gt; A stronger thunderstorm developed around 2 p.m. EDT (18:00 UTC) and produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45 p.m. EDT (18:45 UTC), no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;NJFunnel&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm became stronger and developed into a supercell thunderstorm as it crossed into [[New York]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornado1&quot;/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15 p.m. (21:15 UTC).&lt;ref name=&quot;WCBS&quot;/&gt; At around 3:30 p.m. EDT (19:30 UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100&amp;nbsp;yard (91&amp;nbsp;m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a 3&amp;nbsp;miles (4.8&amp;nbsp;km) path across the river.

					==Impact==
					[[Image:DCP 7760.JPG|thumb|right|Tornado damage near a forested area]]
					The tornado took a clear path through [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]], [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]], and [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield]] counties, downing or uprooting thousands of trees, and damaging several structures, including significant structural damage to the California Closest Warehouse. Six minor injuries were also reported due to the tornado.

					The &#x27;&#x27;&#x27;Westchester Tornado&#x27;&#x27;&#x27; was an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F2]] [[tornado]] that touched down in [[Rockland County, New York]] on July 12, 2006. It traveled 13&amp;nbsp;miles (20.9&amp;nbsp;km) into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33&amp;nbsp;minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling 3&amp;nbsp;mi (4.8&amp;nbsp;km) across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at F1 intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter mile (402&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter,&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; making it both the strongest and largest tornado in the county&#x27;s history.&lt;ref name=&quot;THPWest&quot;/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, causing damage to numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01 p.m. EDT (20:01 UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated near the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03 p.m. EDT (20:03 UTC).&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name=&quot;THPWest&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950-2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

					==Meteorological synopsis==
					On July 12, a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]].

					==Meteorological synopsis==
					On July 12, a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]].

					The &#x27;&#x27;&#x27;Westchester Tornado&#x27;&#x27;&#x27; was an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F2]] [[tornado]] that touched down in [[Rockland County, New York]] on July 12, 2006. It traveled 13&amp;nbsp;miles (20.9&amp;nbsp;km) into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33&amp;nbsp;minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling 3&amp;nbsp;mi (4.8&amp;nbsp;km) across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at F1 intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter mile (402&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter,&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; making it both the strongest and largest tornado in the county&#x27;s history.&lt;ref name=&quot;THPWest&quot;/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, causing damage to numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01 p.m. EDT (20:01 UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated near the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03 p.m. EDT (20:03 UTC).&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name=&quot;THPWest&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950-2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

					The tornado left significant damage in its wake. Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, and a large stained-glass window was shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted. There were no fatalities and only six minor injuries were associated with the storm. Damages from the tornado totaled $12.1&amp;nbsp;million (2006 [[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9&amp;nbsp;million 2008 USD).

					==Meteorological synopsis==
					On July 12, a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornadowatch&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=2006-07-12| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; At around 1:05 p.m. EDT (17:05 UTC), a thunderstorm produced winds up to 60&amp;nbsp;[[miles per hour|mph]] (95&amp;nbsp;[[kilometres per hour|km/h]]) in [[Warren County, New Jersey|Warren County]], which snapped tree limbs and damaged power lines.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tstmwind&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625642 (Thunderstorm Wind)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625642}}&lt;/ref&gt; A stronger thunderstorm developed around 2 p.m. EDT (18:00 UTC) and produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45 p.m. EDT (18:45 UTC), no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;NJFunnel&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornado1&quot;/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15 p.m. (21:15 UTC).&lt;ref name=&quot;WCBS&quot;/&gt; At around 3:30 p.m. EDT (19:30 UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100&amp;nbsp;yard (91&amp;nbsp;m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a 3&amp;nbsp;miles (4.8&amp;nbsp;km) path across the river.

The tornado touched down at 3:30 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling 3&amp;nbsp;mi (4.8&amp;nbsp;km) across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at F1 intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter mile (402&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter,&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; making it both the strongest and largest tornado in the county&#x27;s history.&lt;ref name=&quot;THPWest&quot;/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, causing damage to numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01 p.m. EDT (20:01 UTC).

					The &#x27;&#x27;&#x27;Westchester Tornado&#x27;&#x27;&#x27; was an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F2]] [[tornado]] that touched down in [[Rockland County, New York]] on July 12, 2006. It traveled 13&amp;nbsp;miles (20.9&amp;nbsp;km) into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling 3&amp;nbsp;mi (4.8&amp;nbsp;km) across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at F1 intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter mile (402&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter,&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; making it both the strongest and largest tornado in the county&#x27;s history.&lt;ref name=&quot;THPWest&quot;/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, causing damage to numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01 p.m. EDT (20:01 UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated near the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03 p.m. EDT (20:03 UTC).&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name=&quot;THPWest&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950-2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

					==Meteorological synopsis==
					On July 12, a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]].

					==Meteorological synopsis==
					On July 12, a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]].

					The &#x27;&#x27;&#x27;Westchester Tornado&#x27;&#x27;&#x27; was an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F2]] [[tornado]] that touched down in [[Rockland County, New York]] on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006. It traveled 13&amp;nbsp;miles (20.9&amp;nbsp;km) into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling 3&amp;nbsp;mi (4.8&amp;nbsp;km) across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at F1 intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter mile (402&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter,&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; making it both the strongest and largest tornado in the county&#x27;s history.&lt;ref name=&quot;THPWest&quot;/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, causing damage to numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated near the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:03&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name=&quot;THPWest&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950-2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

					The tornado left significant damage in its wake. Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, and a large stained-glass window was shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted. There were no fatalities and only six minor injuries were associated with the storm. Damages from the tornado totaled $12.1&amp;nbsp;million (2006 [[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9&amp;nbsp;million 2008 USD).

					==Meteorological synopsis==
					On July&amp;nbsp;12, a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornadowatch&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=2006-07-12| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; At around 1:05&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (17:05&amp;nbsp;UTC), a thunderstorm produced winds up to 60&amp;nbsp;[[miles per hour|mph]] (95&amp;nbsp;[[kilometres per hour|km/h]]) in [[Warren County, New Jersey|Warren County]], which snapped tree limbs and damaged power lines.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tstmwind&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625642 (Thunderstorm Wind)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625642}}&lt;/ref&gt; A stronger thunderstorm developed around 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:00&amp;nbsp;UTC) and produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:45&amp;nbsp;UTC), no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;NJFunnel&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornado1&quot;/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (21:15&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name=&quot;WCBS&quot;/&gt; At around 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:30&amp;nbsp;UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100&amp;nbsp;yard (91&amp;nbsp;m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a 3&amp;nbsp;miles (4.8&amp;nbsp;km) path across the river.

					==Impact==
					[[Image:DCP 7760.JPG|thumb|right|Tornado damage near a forested area]]
					The tornado took a path through [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]], [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]], and [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield]] counties, downing or uprooting thousands of trees and damaging several structures, including significant structural damage to the California Closest Warehouse. Six minor injuries were also reported.

					The &#x27;&#x27;&#x27;July 2006 Westchester County tornado&#x27;&#x27;&#x27; was an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F2]] [[tornado]] that touched down in [[Rockland County, New York]] on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006. It traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}} across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at F1 intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter mile (402&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter,&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; making it both the strongest and largest tornado in the county&#x27;s history.&lt;ref name=&quot;THPWest&quot;/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, causing damage to numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated near the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:03&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name=&quot;THPWest&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950-2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

					The tornado left significant damage in its wake. Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, and a large stained-glass window was shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted. There were no fatalities and only six minor injuries were associated with the storm. Damages from the tornado totaled $12.1&amp;nbsp;million (2006 [[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9&amp;nbsp;million 2008 USD).

					==Meteorological synopsis==
					On July&amp;nbsp;12, a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornadowatch&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=2006-07-12| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:00&amp;nbsp;UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:45&amp;nbsp;UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;NJFunnel&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornado1&quot;/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (21:15&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name=&quot;WCBS&quot;/&gt; At around 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:30&amp;nbsp;UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100&amp;nbsp;yard (91&amp;nbsp;m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}} path across the river.

					==Meteorological synopsis==
					On July&amp;nbsp;12, a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]].

Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at F1 intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter,&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; making it both the strongest and largest tornado in the county&#x27;s history.&lt;ref name=&quot;THPWest&quot;/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, causing damage to numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC).

					The &#x27;&#x27;&#x27;July 2006 Westchester County tornado&#x27;&#x27;&#x27; was an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F2]] [[tornado]] that touched down in [[Rockland County, New York]] on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006. It traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at F1 intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter,&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; making it both the strongest and largest tornado in the county&#x27;s history.&lt;ref name=&quot;THPWest&quot;/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, causing damage to numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated near the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:03&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name=&quot;THPWest&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950-2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

					The tornado left significant damage in its wake. Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, and a large stained-glass window was shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted. There were no fatalities and only six minor injuries were associated with the storm. Damages from the tornado totaled $12.1&amp;nbsp;million (2006 [[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9&amp;nbsp;million 2008 USD).

					==Meteorological synopsis==
					On July&amp;nbsp;12, a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornadowatch&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=2006-07-12| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:00&amp;nbsp;UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:45&amp;nbsp;UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;NJFunnel&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornado1&quot;/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (21:15&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name=&quot;WCBS&quot;/&gt; At around 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:30&amp;nbsp;UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100&amp;nbsp;yard (91&amp;nbsp;m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}} path across the river. The tornado passed near the [[Tappan Zee Bridge]] before crossing into [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornado1&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #626587 (Tornado)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~626587}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon entering Westchester, it was the eighth tornado ever recorded in the county.&lt;ref name=&quot;THPWest&quot;/&gt;

As the tornado neared [[New York State Route 9A]], it intensified to F2 status, generating winds up to {{convert|157|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, and struck the California Closet Warehouse.

					==Impact==
					[[Image:DCP 7760.JPG|thumb|right|Tornado damage near a forested area]]
					The tornado took a path through [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]], [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]], and [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield]] counties, downing or uprooting thousands of trees and damaging several structures, including significant structural damage to the California Closest Warehouse. Six minor injuries were also reported.

					Minor damage was reported in Rockland County. One dock and one boat were damaged by the tornado.&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; After crossing the [[Hudson River]], the tornado entered Westchester County, where the worst of the damage took place. It struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]], damaging roofs and tearing the siding off numerous homes and businesses.&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; A 10&amp;nbsp;foot (3&amp;nbsp;m) tall stained-glass window in the St. Teresa of Avila Church was shattered.&lt;ref name=&quot;USAT&quot;/&gt; Afterwards, the town of [[Pocantico Hills, New York|Pocantico Hills]] was struck as the tornado intensified to F2 intensity. Several trees were uprooted and two barns were destroyed. The California Closet Warehouse suffered severe structural damage; two concrete walls were destroyed.&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; An interior staircase, which employees used as a shelter, collapsed causing four injuries.

					The &#x27;&#x27;&#x27;July 2006 Westchester County tornado&#x27;&#x27;&#x27; was an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F2]] [[tornado]] that touched down in [[Rockland County, New York]] on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006. It traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at F1 intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter,&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; making it both the strongest and largest tornado in the county&#x27;s history.&lt;ref name=&quot;THPWest&quot;/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, causing damage to numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated near the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:03&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name=&quot;THPWest&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950-2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

					The tornado left significant damage in its wake. Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, and a large stained-glass window was shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted. There were no fatalities and only six minor injuries were associated with the storm. Damages from the tornado totaled $12.1&amp;nbsp;million (2006 [[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9&amp;nbsp;million 2008 USD).

					==Meteorological synopsis==
					On July&amp;nbsp;12, a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornadowatch&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=2006-07-12| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:00&amp;nbsp;UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:45&amp;nbsp;UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;NJFunnel&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornado1&quot;/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (21:15&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name=&quot;WCBS&quot;/&gt; At around 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:30&amp;nbsp;UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100&amp;nbsp;yard (91&amp;nbsp;m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}} path across the river.

					The &#x27;&#x27;&#x27;2006 Westchester County tornado&#x27;&#x27;&#x27; was an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F2]] [[tornado]] that touched down in [[Rockland County, New York]] on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006. It traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at F1 intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter,&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; making it both the strongest and largest tornado in the county&#x27;s history.&lt;ref name=&quot;THPWest&quot;/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, causing damage to numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:03&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name=&quot;THPWest&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950-2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

					The tornado left significant damage in its wake. Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, and a large stained-glass window was shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted. There were no fatalities and only six minor injuries were associated with the storm. Damages from the tornado totaled $12.1&amp;nbsp;million (2006 [[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9&amp;nbsp;million 2008 USD).

					==Meteorological synopsis==
					On July&amp;nbsp;12, a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornadowatch&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=2006-07-12| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:00&amp;nbsp;UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:45&amp;nbsp;UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;NJFunnel&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornado1&quot;/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (21:15&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name=&quot;WCBS&quot;/&gt; At around 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:30&amp;nbsp;UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100&amp;nbsp;yard (91&amp;nbsp;m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}} path across the river. The tornado passed near the [[Tappan Zee Bridge]] before crossing into [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornado1&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #626587 (Tornado)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~626587}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon entering Westchester, it was the eighth tornado ever recorded in the county.&lt;ref name=&quot;THPWest&quot;/&gt;

As the tornado neared [[New York State Route 9A]], it intensified to F2 status, generating winds up to {{convert|157|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, and struck the California Closet Warehouse.

					==Impact==
					[[Image:DCP 7760.JPG|thumb|right|Tornado damage near a forested area]]
					The tornado took a path through [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]], [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]], and [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield]] counties, downing or uprooting thousands of trees and damaging several structures, including significant structural damage to the California Closest Warehouse. Six minor injuries were also reported. In all, the tornado inflicted $12.1&amp;nbsp;million (2006&amp;nbsp;[[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9&amp;nbsp;million 2008 USD) in damage.&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt;

					Minor damage was reported in Rockland County. One dock and one boat were damaged by the tornado.&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; After crossing the [[Hudson River]], the tornado entered Westchester County, where the worst of the damage took place. It struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]], damaging roofs and tearing the siding off numerous homes and businesses.&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; A 10&amp;nbsp;foot (3&amp;nbsp;m) tall stained-glass window in the St. Teresa of Avila Church was shattered.&lt;ref name=&quot;USAT&quot;/&gt; Afterwards, the town of [[Pocantico Hills, New York|Pocantico Hills]] was struck as the tornado intensified to F2 intensity. Several trees were uprooted and two barns were destroyed. The California Closet Warehouse suffered severe structural damage; two concrete walls were destroyed.&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; An interior staircase, which employees used as a shelter, collapsed causing four injuries.

					The &#x27;&#x27;&#x27;2006 Westchester County tornado&#x27;&#x27;&#x27; was an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F2]] [[tornado]] that touched down in [[Rockland County, New York]] on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006. It traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at F1 intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter,&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; making it both the strongest and largest tornado in the county&#x27;s history.&lt;ref name=&quot;THPWest&quot;/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, causing damage to numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:03&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name=&quot;THPWest&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950-2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

					The tornado left significant damage in its wake. Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, and a large stained-glass window was shattered.

					==Meteorological synopsis==
					On July&amp;nbsp;12, a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornadowatch&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=2006-07-12| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:00&amp;nbsp;UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:45&amp;nbsp;UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;NJFunnel&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornado1&quot;/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (21:15&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name=&quot;WCBS&quot;/&gt; At around 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:30&amp;nbsp;UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100&amp;nbsp;yard (91&amp;nbsp;m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}} path across the river.

					==Meteorological synopsis==
					On July&amp;nbsp;12, a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]].

					The &#x27;&#x27;&#x27;2006 Westchester County tornado&#x27;&#x27;&#x27; was an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F2]] [[tornado]] that touched down in [[Rockland County, New York]], on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006. It traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at F1 intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter,&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; making it both the strongest and largest tornado in the county&#x27;s history.&lt;ref name=&quot;THPWest&quot;/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, causing damage to numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:03&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name=&quot;THPWest&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950-2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

					The tornado left significant damage in its wake. Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, and a large stained-glass window was shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted. There were no fatalities and only six minor injuries were associated with the storm. Damages from the tornado totaled $12.1&amp;nbsp;million (2006 [[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9&amp;nbsp;million 2008 USD).

					==Meteorological synopsis==
					On July&amp;nbsp;12, a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornadowatch&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=2006-07-12| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:00&amp;nbsp;UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:45&amp;nbsp;UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;NJFunnel&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornado1&quot;/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (21:15&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name=&quot;WCBS&quot;/&gt; At around 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:30&amp;nbsp;UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100&amp;nbsp;yard (91&amp;nbsp;m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}} path across the river. The tornado passed near the [[Tappan Zee Bridge]] before crossing into [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornado1&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #626587 (Tornado)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~626587}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon entering Westchester, it was the eighth tornado ever recorded in the county.&lt;ref name=&quot;THPWest&quot;/&gt;

As the tornado neared [[New York State Route 9A]], it intensified to F2 status, generating winds up to {{convert|157|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, and struck the California Closet Warehouse.

					==Impact==
					[[Image:DCP 7760.JPG|thumb|right|Tornado damage near a [[forest]]ed area]]
					The tornado took a path through [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]], [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]], and [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield]] counties, downing or uprooting thousands of trees and damaging several structures, including significant structural damage to the California Closest Warehouse. Six minor injuries were also reported.

					Minor damage was reported in Rockland County. One dock and one boat were damaged by the tornado.&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; After crossing the [[Hudson River]], the tornado entered Westchester County, where the worst of the damage took place.

					The &#x27;&#x27;&#x27;2006 Westchester County tornado&#x27;&#x27;&#x27; was an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F2]] [[tornado]] that touched down in [[Rockland County, New York]], on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006. It traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at F1 intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter,&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; making it both the strongest and largest tornado in the county&#x27;s history.&lt;ref name=&quot;THPWest&quot;/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:03&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name=&quot;THPWest&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950-2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

					Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, and a large stained-glass window was shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted.

					==Meteorological synopsis==
					On July&amp;nbsp;12, a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornadowatch&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=2006-07-12| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:00&amp;nbsp;UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:45&amp;nbsp;UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;NJFunnel&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornado1&quot;/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (21:15&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name=&quot;WCBS&quot;/&gt; At around 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:30&amp;nbsp;UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100&amp;nbsp;yard (91&amp;nbsp;m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}} path across the river. The tornado passed near the [[Tappan Zee Bridge]] before crossing into [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornado1&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #626587 (Tornado)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~626587}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon entering Westchester, it was the eighth tornado ever recorded in the county.&lt;ref name=&quot;THPWest&quot;/&gt;

					==Meteorological synopsis==
					On July&amp;nbsp;12, a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornadowatch&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=2006-07-12| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:00&amp;nbsp;UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:45&amp;nbsp;UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;NJFunnel&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornado1&quot;/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (21:15&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name=&quot;WCBS&quot;/&gt; At around 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:30&amp;nbsp;UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100&amp;nbsp;yard (91&amp;nbsp;m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}} path across the river.

					The &#x27;&#x27;&#x27;2006 Westchester County tornado&#x27;&#x27;&#x27; was an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F2]] [[tornado]] that touched little kids down on their penis&#x27;s in [[Rockland County, New York]], on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006. It traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at F1 intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter,&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; making it both the strongest and largest tornado in the county&#x27;s history.&lt;ref name=&quot;THPWest&quot;/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC).

					[[File:Radar image of westchester 2006 supercell.png|thumb|left|[[Weather radar]] image of the supercell thunderstorm that spawned the tornado at 3:45&amp;nbsp;pm EDT]]
					On July&amp;nbsp;12 a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornadowatch&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=2006-07-12| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:00&amp;nbsp;UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:45&amp;nbsp;UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;NJFunnel&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornado1&quot;/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (21:15&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name=&quot;WCBS&quot;/&gt; At around 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:30&amp;nbsp;UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100&amp;nbsp;yard (91&amp;nbsp;m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}} path across the river.

					The tornado took a path through [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]], [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]], and [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield]] counties, downing or uprooting thousands of trees and damaging several structures, including significant structural damage to the California Closest Warehouse. Six minor injuries were also reported.

					The &#x27;&#x27;&#x27;2006 Westchester County tornado&#x27;&#x27;&#x27; was an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F2]] [[tornado]] that touched down in [[Rockland County, New York]], on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006. It traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at F1 intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter,&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; making it both the strongest and largest tornado in the county&#x27;s history.&lt;ref name=&quot;THPWest&quot;/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:03&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name=&quot;THPWest&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950-2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

					Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, and a large stained-glass window was shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted. There were no fatalities and only six minor injuries were associated with the storm.

					On July&amp;nbsp;12 a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornadowatch&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=2006-07-12| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:00&amp;nbsp;UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:45&amp;nbsp;UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;NJFunnel&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornado1&quot;/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (21:15&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name=&quot;WCBS&quot;/&gt; At around 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:30&amp;nbsp;UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]].

					The &#x27;&#x27;&#x27;2006 Westchester County tornado&#x27;&#x27;&#x27; was an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F2]] [[tornado]] that touched down in [[Rockland County, New York]], on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006.

Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at F1 intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter,&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; making it both the strongest and largest tornado in the county&#x27;s history.&lt;ref name=&quot;THPWest&quot;/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC).

					The &#x27;&#x27;&#x27;2006 Westchester County tornado&#x27;&#x27;&#x27; was an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F2]] [[tornado]] that touched down in [[Rockland County, New York]], on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006. It traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at F1 intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter,&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; making it both the strongest and largest tornado in the county&#x27;s history.&lt;ref name=&quot;THPWest&quot;/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:03&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name=&quot;THPWest&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950-2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

					Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, and a large stained-glass window was shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted. There were no fatalities and only six minor injuries were associated with the storm.

					On July&amp;nbsp;12 a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornadowatch&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=2006-07-12| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:00&amp;nbsp;UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:45&amp;nbsp;UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;NJFunnel&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornado1&quot;/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (21:15&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name=&quot;WCBS&quot;/&gt; At around 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:30&amp;nbsp;UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100&amp;nbsp;yard (91&amp;nbsp;m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}} path across the river.

					On July&amp;nbsp;12 a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornadowatch&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=2006-07-12| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:00&amp;nbsp;UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:45&amp;nbsp;UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;NJFunnel&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornado1&quot;/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (21:15&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name=&quot;WCBS&quot;/&gt; At around 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:30&amp;nbsp;UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100&amp;nbsp;yard (91&amp;nbsp;m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}} path across the river.

					The &#x27;&#x27;&#x27;2006 Westchester County tornado&#x27;&#x27;&#x27; was the strongest and largest [[tornado]] in the history of [[Rockland County, New York]].&lt;ref name=&quot;THPWest&quot;/&gt; Touching down in [[Rockland County, New York]], on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006, it traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at F1 intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter.&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC).

					[[File:Radar image of westchester 2006 supercell.png|thumb|left|[[Weather radar]] image of the supercell thunderstorm that spawned the tornado at 3:45&amp;nbsp;pm EDT]]
					On July&amp;nbsp;12 a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornadowatch&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=2006-07-12| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:00&amp;nbsp;UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:45&amp;nbsp;UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;NJFunnel&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornado1&quot;/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (21:15&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name=&quot;WCBS&quot;/&gt; At around 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:30&amp;nbsp;UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100&amp;nbsp;yard (91&amp;nbsp;m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}} path across the river.

As the tornado neared [[New York State Route 9A]], it intensified to F2 status, generating winds up to {{convert|157|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, and struck the California Closet Warehouse.

					The tornado took a path through [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]], [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]], and [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield]] counties, downing or uprooting thousands of trees and damaging several structures, including significant structural damage to the California Closest Warehouse. Six minor injuries were also reported.

					Minor damage was reported in Rockland County. One dock and one boat were damaged by the tornado.&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; After crossing the [[Hudson River]], the tornado entered Westchester County, where the worst of the damage took place.

					The &#x27;&#x27;&#x27;2006 Westchester County tornado&#x27;&#x27;&#x27; was the strongest and largest [[tornado]] in the history of [[Rockland County, New York]].&lt;ref name=&quot;THPWest&quot;/&gt; It touched down there on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006 and traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter.&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:03&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name=&quot;THPWest&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950-2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

					On July&amp;nbsp;12 a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornadowatch&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=2006-07-12| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:00&amp;nbsp;UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:45&amp;nbsp;UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;NJFunnel&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornado1&quot;/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (21:15&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name=&quot;WCBS&quot;/&gt; At around 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:30&amp;nbsp;UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]].

					[[File:Radar image of westchester 2006 supercell.png|thumb|left|[[Weather radar]] image of the supercell thunderstorm that spawned the tornado at 3:45&amp;nbsp;pm EDT]]
					On [[July 12]] a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name=%26quot%3BTornadowatch%26quot%3B%26gt%3B%7B%7Bcite web| author=Thompson| date=2006-07-12| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:00&amp;nbsp;UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:45&amp;nbsp;UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name=%26quot%3BNJFunnel%26quot%3B%26gt%3B%7B%7Bcite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]].&lt;ref name=%26quot%3BTornado1%26quot%3B%2F%26gt%3B About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (21:15&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name=%26quot%3BWCBS%26quot%3B%2F%26gt%3B At around 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:30&amp;nbsp;UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100&amp;nbsp;yard (91&amp;nbsp;m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}} path across the river.

					==Impact==
					[[Image:DCP 7760.JPG|thumb|right|Tornado damage near a [[forest]]ed area]]
					The tornado took a path through [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]], [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]], and [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield]] counties, downing or uprooting thousands of trees and damaging several structures, including significant structural damage to the California Closest Warehouse. Six minor injuries were also reported.

					The &#x27;&#x27;&#x27;2006 Westchester County tornado&#x27;&#x27;&#x27; was the strongest and largest [[tornado]] in the history of [[Rockland County, New York]].&lt;ref name=&quot;THPWest&quot;/&gt; It touched down there on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006 and traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter.&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:03&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name=&quot;THPWest&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950-2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

					Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, and a large stained-glass window was shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted.

					[[File:Radar image of westchester 2006 supercell.png|thumb|left|[[Weather radar]] image of the supercell thunderstorm that spawned the tornado at 3:45&amp;nbsp;pm EDT]]
					On July&amp;nbsp;12 a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornadowatch&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=2006-07-12| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:00&amp;nbsp;UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:45&amp;nbsp;UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;NJFunnel&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornado1&quot;/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (21:15&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name=&quot;WCBS&quot;/&gt; At around 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:30&amp;nbsp;UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100&amp;nbsp;yard (91&amp;nbsp;m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}} path across the river.

As the tornado neared [[New York State Route 9A]], it intensified to F2 status, generating winds up to {{convert|157|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, and struck the California Closet Warehouse.

					The &#x27;&#x27;&#x27;2006 Westchester County tornado&#x27;&#x27;&#x27; was the strongest and largest [[tornado]] in the history of [[Westchester County, New York]].&lt;ref name=&quot;THPWest&quot;/&gt; It touched down there on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006 and traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter.&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC).

					On July&amp;nbsp;12 a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]].

					[[File:Radar image of westchester 2006 supercell.png|thumb|left|[[Weather radar]] image of the supercell thunderstorm that spawned the tornado at 3:45&amp;nbsp;pm EDT]]
					On July&amp;nbsp;12 a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornadowatch&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=2006-07-12| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:00&amp;nbsp;UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:45&amp;nbsp;UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;NJFunnel&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornado1&quot;/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (21:15&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name=&quot;WCBS&quot;/&gt; At around 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:30&amp;nbsp;UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100&amp;nbsp;yard (91&amp;nbsp;m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}} path across the river.

As the tornado neared [[New York State Route 9A]], it intensified to F2 status, generating winds up to {{convert|157|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, and struck the California Closet Warehouse.

					The &#x27;&#x27;&#x27;2006 Westchester County tornado&#x27;&#x27;&#x27; was the strongest and largest [[tornado]] in the history of [[Westchester County, New York]].&lt;ref name=&quot;THPWest&quot;/&gt; It touched down there on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006 and traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter.&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:03&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name=&quot;THPWest&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950-2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

					Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, and a large stained-glass window was shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted. There were no fatalities and only six minor injuries were associated with the storm. The cost of damages was estimated at $12.1&amp;nbsp;million (2006 [[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9&amp;nbsp;million 2008 USD).

					[[File:Radar image of westchester 2006 supercell.png|thumb|left|[[Weather radar]] image of the supercell thunderstorm that spawned the tornado at 3:45&amp;nbsp;pm EDT]]
					On July&amp;nbsp;12 a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornadowatch&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=2006-07-12| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:00&amp;nbsp;UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:45&amp;nbsp;UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;NJFunnel&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornado1&quot;/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (21:15&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name=&quot;WCBS&quot;/&gt; At around 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:30&amp;nbsp;UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100&amp;nbsp;yard (91&amp;nbsp;m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}} path across the river.

As the tornado neared [[New York State Route 9A]], it intensified to F2 status, generating winds up to {{convert|157|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, and struck the California Closet Warehouse.

					The &#x27;&#x27;&#x27;2006 Westchester County tornado&#x27;&#x27;&#x27; was the strongest and largest [[tornado]] in the history of [[Westchester County, New York]].&lt;ref name=&quot;THPWest&quot;/&gt; It touched down there on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006 and traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states.

					[[File:Radar image of westchester 2006 supercell.png|thumb|left|[[Weather radar]] image of the supercell thunderstorm that spawned the tornado at 3:45&amp;nbsp;pm EDT]]
					On July&amp;nbsp;12 a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornadowatch&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=2006-07-12| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:00&amp;nbsp;UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:45&amp;nbsp;UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;NJFunnel&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornado1&quot;/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (21:15&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name=&quot;WCBS&quot;/&gt; At around 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:30&amp;nbsp;UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100&amp;nbsp;yard (91&amp;nbsp;m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}} path across the river.

As the tornado neared [[New York State Route 9A]], it intensified to F2 status, generating winds up to {{convert|157|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, and struck the California Closet Warehouse.

					==Impact==
					[[Image:DCP 7760.JPG|thumb|right|Tornado damage near a [[forest]]ed area]]
					The tornado took a path through [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]], [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]], and [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield]] counties, downing or uprooting thousands of trees and damaging several structures, including significant structural damage to the California Closest Warehouse. Six minor injuries were also reported.

					Minor damage was reported in Rockland County. One dock and one boat were damaged by the tornado.&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; After crossing the [[Hudson River]], the tornado entered Westchester County, where the worst of the damage took place.

					The &#x27;&#x27;&#x27;2006 Westchester County tornado&#x27;&#x27;&#x27; was the strongest and largest [[tornado]] in the history of [[Westchester County, New York]].&lt;ref name=&quot;THPWest&quot;/&gt; It touched down there on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006 and traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter.&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:03&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name=&quot;THPWest&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950-2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

					Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, and a large stained-glass window was shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted. There were no fatalities and only six minor injuries were associated with the storm. The cost of damages was estimated at $12.1&amp;nbsp;million (2006 [[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9&amp;nbsp;million 2008 USD).

					[[File:Radar image of westchester 2006 supercell.png|thumb|left|[[Weather radar]] image of the supercell thunderstorm that spawned the tornado at 3:45&amp;nbsp;pm EDT]]
					On July&amp;nbsp;12 a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornadowatch&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=2006-07-12| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:00&amp;nbsp;UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:45&amp;nbsp;UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;NJFunnel&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornado1&quot;/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (21:15&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name=&quot;WCBS&quot;/&gt; At around 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:30&amp;nbsp;UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100&amp;nbsp;yard (91&amp;nbsp;m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}} path across the river.

					The &#x27;&#x27;&#x27;2006 Westchester County tornado&#x27;&#x27;&#x27; was the strongest and largest [[tornado]] in the history of [[Westchester County, New York]].&lt;ref name=&quot;THPWest&quot;/&gt; It touched down there on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006 and traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter.&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:03&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name=&quot;THPWest&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950-2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

					Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, and a large stained-glass window was shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted. There were no fatalities and only six minor injuries were associated with the storm. The cost of damages was estimated at $12.1&amp;nbsp;million (2006 [[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9&amp;nbsp;million 2008 USD).

					Authorities admitted they were embarrassed after originally believing the tornado had touched down in [[Newark]], [[New Jersey]] and leveled the entire city.  They later found out that all of New Jersey has the overall look and feel of a shithole, and quickly corrected their innocent mistake.

					On July&amp;nbsp;12 a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornadowatch&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=2006-07-12| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:00&amp;nbsp;UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:45&amp;nbsp;UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;NJFunnel&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornado1&quot;/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (21:15&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name=&quot;WCBS&quot;/&gt; At around 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:30&amp;nbsp;UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]].

					On July&amp;nbsp;12 a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornadowatch&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=2006-07-12| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:00&amp;nbsp;UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:45&amp;nbsp;UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;NJFunnel&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornado1&quot;/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (21:15&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name=&quot;WCBS&quot;/&gt; At around 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:30&amp;nbsp;UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100&amp;nbsp;yard (91&amp;nbsp;m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}} path across the river.

					Minor damage was reported in Rockland County. One dock and one boat were damaged by the tornado.&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; After crossing the [[Hudson River]], the tornado entered Westchester County, where the worst of the damage took place.

					The &#x27;&#x27;&#x27;2006 Westchester County tornado&#x27;&#x27;&#x27; was the strongest and largest [[tornado]] in the history of [[Westchester County, New York]].&lt;ref name=&quot;THPWest&quot;/&gt; It touched down there on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006 and traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter.&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:03&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name=&quot;THPWest&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950-2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

					Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, and a large stained-glass window was shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted. There were no fatalities and only six minor injuries were associated with the storm. The cost of damages was estimated at $12.1&amp;nbsp;million (2006 [[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9&amp;nbsp;million 2008 USD).

					==Meteorological synopsis==
					[[File:Radar image of westchester 2006 supercell.png|thumb|left|[[Weather radar]] image of the supercell thunderstorm that spawned the tornado at 3:45&amp;nbsp;pm EDT]]
					On July&amp;nbsp;12 a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornadowatch&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=2006-07-12| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:00&amp;nbsp;UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:45&amp;nbsp;UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;NJFunnel&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornado1&quot;/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (21:15&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name=&quot;WCBS&quot;/&gt; At around 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:30&amp;nbsp;UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100&amp;nbsp;yard (91&amp;nbsp;m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}} path across the river. The tornado passed near the [[Tappan Zee Bridge]] before crossing into [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornado1&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #626587 (Tornado)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~626587}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon entering Westchester, it was the eighth tornado ever recorded in the county.&lt;ref name=&quot;THPWest&quot;/&gt;

As the tornado neared [[New York State Route 9A]], it intensified to F2 status, generating winds up to {{convert|157|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, and struck the California Closet Warehouse. At the time, the tornado was estimated to be 300&amp;nbsp;yd (274&amp;nbsp;m) wide&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornado2&quot;/&gt; and was the strongest tornado ever recorded in Westchester County.&lt;ref name=&quot;USAT&quot;&gt;{{cite news| author=Jim Fitzgerald| date=2006-07-14| title=Weather Service confirms F-2 tornado roared through N.Y., Conn. on Wednesday| work=[[USA Today]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.usatoday.com/weather/storms/2006-07-14-ny-tornado-confirmed_x.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after, it weakened back to F1 intensity.

					The tornado took a path through [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]], [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]], and [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield]] counties, downing or uprooting thousands of trees and damaging several structures, including significant structural damage to the California Closest Warehouse. Six minor injuries were also reported.

					Minor damage was reported in Rockland County. One dock and one boat were damaged by the tornado.&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; After crossing the [[Hudson River]], the tornado entered Westchester County, where the worst of the damage took place.

					The &#x27;&#x27;&#x27;2006 Westchester County tornado&#x27;&#x27;&#x27; was the strongest and largest [[tornado]] in the history of [[Westchester County, New York]].&lt;ref name=&quot;THPWest&quot;/&gt; It touched down there on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006 and traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter.&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:03&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name=&quot;THPWest&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950-2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

					On July&amp;nbsp;12 a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornadowatch&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=2006-07-12| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:00&amp;nbsp;UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:45&amp;nbsp;UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;NJFunnel&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornado1&quot;/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (21:15&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name=&quot;WCBS&quot;/&gt; At around 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:30&amp;nbsp;UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]].

					On July&amp;nbsp;12 a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornadowatch&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=2006-07-12| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:00&amp;nbsp;UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:45&amp;nbsp;UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;NJFunnel&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornado1&quot;/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (21:15&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name=&quot;WCBS&quot;/&gt; At around 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:30&amp;nbsp;UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100&amp;nbsp;yard (91&amp;nbsp;m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}} path across the river.

As the tornado neared [[New York State Route 9A]], it intensified to F2 status, generating winds up to {{convert|157|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, and struck the California Closet Warehouse.

					The &#x27;&#x27;&#x27;2006 Westchester County tornado&#x27;&#x27;&#x27; was the strongest and largest [[tornado]] in the history of [[Westchester County, New York]].&lt;ref name=&quot;THPWest&quot;/&gt; It touched down there on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006 and traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter.&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:03&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name=&quot;THPWest&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950-2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

					Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, and a large stained-glass window was shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted.

					==Meteorological synopsis==
					[[File:Radar image of westchester 2006 supercell.png|thumb|left|[[Weather radar]] image of the supercell thunderstorm that spawned the tornado at 3:45&amp;nbsp;pm EDT]]
					On July&amp;nbsp;12 a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornadowatch&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=2006-07-12| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:00&amp;nbsp;UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:45&amp;nbsp;UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;NJFunnel&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornado1&quot;/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (21:15&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name=&quot;WCBS&quot;/&gt; At around 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:30&amp;nbsp;UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100&amp;nbsp;yard (91&amp;nbsp;m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}} path across the river.

As the tornado neared [[New York State Route 9A]], it intensified to F2 status, generating winds up to {{convert|157|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, and struck the California Closet Warehouse.

					==Impact==
					[[Image:DCP 7760.JPG|thumb|right|Tornado damage near a [[forest]]ed area]]
					The tornado took a path through [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]], [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]], and [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield]] counties, downing or uprooting thousands of trees and damaging several structures, including significant structural damage to the California Closets warehouse. Six minor injuries were also reported.

					Minor damage was reported in Rockland County. One dock and one boat were damaged by the tornado.&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; After crossing the [[Hudson River]], the tornado entered Westchester County, where the worst of the damage took place.

					The &#x27;&#x27;&#x27;2006 Westchester County tornado&#x27;&#x27;&#x27; was the strongest and largest [[tornado]] in the history of [[Westchester County, New York]].&lt;ref name=&quot;THPWest&quot;/&gt; It touched down there on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006 and traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter.&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:03&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name=&quot;THPWest&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950-2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

					On July&amp;nbsp;12 a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]].

					[[File:July 12, 2006 Westchester Tornado.gif|thumb|left|[[Weather radar]] animation of the supercell that spawned the tornado at 3:45&amp;nbsp;pm EDT]]
					On July&amp;nbsp;12 a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornadowatch&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=2006-07-12| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:00&amp;nbsp;UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:45&amp;nbsp;UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;NJFunnel&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornado1&quot;/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (21:15&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name=&quot;WCBS&quot;/&gt; At around 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:30&amp;nbsp;UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100&amp;nbsp;yard (91&amp;nbsp;m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}} path across the river.

As the tornado neared [[New York State Route 9A]], it intensified to F2 status, generating winds up to {{convert|157|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, and struck the California Closet Warehouse.

					Minor damage was reported in Rockland County. One dock and one boat were damaged by the tornado.&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; After crossing the [[Hudson River]], the tornado entered Westchester County, where the worst of the damage took place.

					The &#x27;&#x27;&#x27;2006 Westchester County tornado&#x27;&#x27;&#x27;, caused by a massive [[fart]], was the strongest and largest [[tornado]] in the history of [[Westchester County, New York]].&lt;ref name=&quot;THPWest&quot;/&gt; It touched down there on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006 and traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter.&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:03&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name=&quot;THPWest&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950-2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

					Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, and a large stained-glass window was shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted.

					On July&amp;nbsp;12 a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornadowatch&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=2006-07-12| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:00&amp;nbsp;UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:45&amp;nbsp;UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;NJFunnel&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornado1&quot;/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (21:15&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name=&quot;WCBS&quot;/&gt; At around 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:30&amp;nbsp;UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100&amp;nbsp;yard (91&amp;nbsp;m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}} path across the river.

					On July&amp;nbsp;12 a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornadowatch&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=2006-07-12| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:00&amp;nbsp;UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:45&amp;nbsp;UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;NJFunnel&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornado1&quot;/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (21:15&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name=&quot;WCBS&quot;/&gt; At around 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:30&amp;nbsp;UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100&amp;nbsp;yard (91&amp;nbsp;m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}} path across the river.

As the tornado neared [[New York State Route 9A]], it intensified to F2 status, generating winds up to {{convert|157|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, and struck the California Closet Warehouse.

					The tornado took a path through [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]], [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]], and [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield]] counties, downing or uprooting thousands of trees and damaging several structures, including significant structural damage to the California Closets warehouse. Six minor injuries were also reported.

					Minor damage was reported in Rockland County. One dock and one boat were damaged by the tornado.&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; After crossing the [[Hudson River]], the tornado entered Westchester County, where the worst of the damage took place.

					The &#x27;&#x27;&#x27;2006 Westchester County tornado&#x27;&#x27;&#x27; was the strongest and largest [[tornado]] in the history of [[Westchester County, New York]].&lt;ref name=&quot;THPWest&quot;/&gt; It touched down there on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006 and traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter.&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:03&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name=&quot;THPWest&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950-2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

					Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, and a large stained-glass window was shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted.

					[[File:July 12, 2006 Westchester Tornado.gif|thumb|left|[[Weather radar]] animation of the supercell that spawned the tornado at 3:45&amp;nbsp;pm EDT]]
					On July&amp;nbsp;12 a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornadowatch&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=2006-07-12| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:00&amp;nbsp;UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:45&amp;nbsp;UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;NJFunnel&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornado1&quot;/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (21:15&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name=&quot;WCBS&quot;/&gt; At around 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:30&amp;nbsp;UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100&amp;nbsp;yard (91&amp;nbsp;m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}} path across the river. The tornado passed near the [[Tappan Zee Bridge]] before crossing into [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornado1&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #626587 (Tornado)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~626587}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon entering Westchester, it was the eighth tornado ever recorded in the county.&lt;ref name=&quot;THPWest&quot;/&gt;

As the tornado neared [[New York State Route 9A]], it intensified to F2 status, generating winds up to {{convert|157|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, and struck the California Closet Warehouse. At the time, the tornado was estimated to be 300&amp;nbsp;yd (274&amp;nbsp;m) wide&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornado2&quot;/&gt; and was the strongest tornado ever recorded in Westchester County.&lt;ref name=&quot;USAT&quot;&gt;{{cite news| author=Jim Fitzgerald| date=2006-07-14| title=Weather Service confirms F-2 tornado roared through N.Y., Conn. on Wednesday| work=[[USA Today]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.usatoday.com/weather/storms/2006-07-14-ny-tornado-confirmed_x.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after, it weakened back to F1 intensity.

					==Impact==
					[[Image:DCP 7760.JPG|thumb|right|Tornado damage near a [[forest]]ed area]]
					The tornado took a path through [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]], [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]], and [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield]] counties, downing or uprooting thousands of trees and damaging several structures, including significant structural damage to the California Closets warehouse. Six minor injuries were also reported.

					Minor damage was reported in Rockland County. One dock and one boat were damaged by the tornado.&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; After crossing the [[Hudson River]], the tornado entered Westchester County, where the worst of the damage took place.

					The &#x27;&#x27;&#x27;2006 Westchester County tornado&#x27;&#x27;&#x27; was the strongest and largest [[tornado]] in the history of [[Westchester County, New York]].&lt;ref name=&quot;THPWest&quot;/&gt; It touched down there on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006 and traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter.&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC).

					On July&amp;nbsp;12 a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]].

					[[File:July 12, 2006 Westchester Tornado.gif|thumb|left|[[Weather radar]] animation of the supercell that spawned the tornado at 3:45&amp;nbsp;pm EDT]]
					On July&amp;nbsp;12 a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornadowatch&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=2006-07-12| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:00&amp;nbsp;UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:45&amp;nbsp;UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;NJFunnel&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornado1&quot;/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (21:15&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name=&quot;WCBS&quot;/&gt; At around 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:30&amp;nbsp;UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100&amp;nbsp;yard (91&amp;nbsp;m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}} path across the river.

As the tornado neared [[New York State Route 9A]], it intensified to F2 status, generating winds up to {{convert|157|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, and struck the California Closet Warehouse.

					The &#x27;&#x27;&#x27;2006 Westchester County tornado&#x27;&#x27;&#x27; was the strongest and largest [[tornado]] in the history of [[Westchester County, New York]].&lt;ref name=&quot;THPWest&quot;/&gt; It touched down there on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006 and traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter.&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:03&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name=&quot;THPWest&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950-2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

					On July&amp;nbsp;12 a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornadowatch&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=2006-07-12| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:00&amp;nbsp;UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:45&amp;nbsp;UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;NJFunnel&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornado1&quot;/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (21:15&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name=&quot;WCBS&quot;/&gt; At around 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:30&amp;nbsp;UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100&amp;nbsp;yard (91&amp;nbsp;m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}} path across the river.

					==Meteorological synopsis==
					[[File:July 12, 2006 Westchester Tornado.gif|thumb|left|[[Weather radar]] animation of the supercell that spawned the tornado at 3:45&amp;nbsp;pm EDT]]
					On July&amp;nbsp;12 a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornadowatch&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=2006-07-12| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:00&amp;nbsp;UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:45&amp;nbsp;UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;NJFunnel&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornado1&quot;/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (21:15&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name=&quot;WCBS&quot;/&gt; At around 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:30&amp;nbsp;UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100&amp;nbsp;yard (91&amp;nbsp;m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}} path across the river.

As the tornado neared [[New York State Route 9A]], it intensified to F2 status, generating winds up to {{convert|157|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, and struck the California Closet Warehouse. At the time, the tornado was estimated to be 300&amp;nbsp;yd (274&amp;nbsp;m) wide&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornado2&quot;/&gt; and was the strongest tornado ever recorded in Westchester County.&lt;ref name=&quot;USAT&quot;&gt;{{cite news| author=Jim Fitzgerald| date=2006-07-14| title=Weather Service confirms F-2 tornado roared through N.Y., Conn. on Wednesday| work=[[USA Today]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.usatoday.com/weather/storms/2006-07-14-ny-tornado-confirmed_x.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after, it weakened back to F1 intensity.

					Minor damage was reported in Rockland County. One dock and one boat were damaged by the tornado.&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; After crossing the [[Hudson River]], the tornado entered Westchester County, where the worst of the damage took place.

					The &#x27;&#x27;&#x27;2006 Westchester County tornado&#x27;&#x27;&#x27; was the strongest and largest [[tornado]] in the history of [[Westchester County, New York]].&lt;ref name=&quot;THPWest&quot;/&gt; It touched down there on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006 and traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter.&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:03&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name=&quot;THPWest&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950-2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

					Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, and a large stained-glass window was shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted.

					On July&amp;nbsp;12 a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornadowatch&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=2006-07-12| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:00&amp;nbsp;UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:45&amp;nbsp;UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;NJFunnel&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornado1&quot;/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (21:15&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name=&quot;WCBS&quot;/&gt; At around 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:30&amp;nbsp;UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100&amp;nbsp;yard (91&amp;nbsp;m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}} path across the river.

					The &#x27;&#x27;&#x27;2006 Westchester County tornado&#x27;&#x27;&#x27; was the strongest and largest [[tornado]] in the history of [[Westchester County, New York]].&lt;ref name=&quot;THPWest&quot;/&gt; It touched down there on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006 and traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states.

					[[File:July 12, 2006 Westchester Tornado.gif|thumb|left|[[Weather radar]] animation of the supercell that spawned the tornado at 3:45&amp;nbsp;pm EDT]]
					On July&amp;nbsp;12 a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornadowatch&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=2006-07-12| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:00&amp;nbsp;UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:45&amp;nbsp;UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;NJFunnel&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornado1&quot;/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (21:15&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name=&quot;WCBS&quot;/&gt; At around 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:30&amp;nbsp;UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100&amp;nbsp;yard (91&amp;nbsp;m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}} path across the river. The tornado passed near the [[Tappan Zee Bridge]] before crossing into [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornado1&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #626587 (Tornado)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~626587}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon entering Westchester, it was the eighth tornado ever recorded in the county.&lt;ref name=&quot;THPWest&quot;/&gt;

As the tornado neared [[New York State Route 9A]], it intensified to F2 status, generating winds up to {{convert|157|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, and struck the California Closet Warehouse. At the time, the tornado was estimated to be 300&amp;nbsp;yd (274&amp;nbsp;m) wide&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornado2&quot;/&gt; and was the strongest tornado ever recorded in Westchester County.&lt;ref name=&quot;USAT&quot;&gt;{{cite news| author=Jim Fitzgerald| date=2006-07-14| title=Weather Service confirms F-2 tornado roared through N.Y., Conn. on Wednesday| work=[[USA Today]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.usatoday.com/weather/storms/2006-07-14-ny-tornado-confirmed_x.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after, it weakened back to F1 intensity.

					The &#x27;&#x27;&#x27;2006 Westchester County tornado&#x27;&#x27;&#x27; was the strongest and largest [[tornado]] in the history of [[Westchester County, New York]].&lt;ref name=&quot;THPWest&quot;/&gt; It touched down there on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006 and traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter.&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:03&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name=&quot;THPWest&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950-2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

					Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, and a large stained-glass window was shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted.

					On July&amp;nbsp;12 a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornadowatch&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=2006-07-12| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:00&amp;nbsp;UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:45&amp;nbsp;UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;NJFunnel&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornado1&quot;/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (21:15&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name=&quot;WCBS&quot;/&gt; At around 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:30&amp;nbsp;UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100&amp;nbsp;yard (91&amp;nbsp;m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}} path across the river.

					On July&amp;nbsp;12 a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornadowatch&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=2006-07-12| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:00&amp;nbsp;UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:45&amp;nbsp;UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;NJFunnel&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornado1&quot;/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (21:15&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name=&quot;WCBS&quot;/&gt; At around 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:30&amp;nbsp;UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100&amp;nbsp;yard (91&amp;nbsp;m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}} path across the river.

					The &#x27;&#x27;&#x27;2006 Westchester County tornado&#x27;&#x27;&#x27; was the strongest and largest [[tornado]] in the history of [[Westchester County, New York]].&lt;ref name=&quot;THPWest&quot;/&gt; It touched down there on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006 and traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter.&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:03&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name=&quot;THPWest&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950-2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

					Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, and a large stained-glass window was shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted.

					[[File:July 12, 2006 Westchester Tornado.gif|thumb|left|[[Weather radar]] animation of the supercell that spawned the tornado at 3:45&amp;nbsp;pm EDT]]
					On July&amp;nbsp;12 a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornadowatch&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=2006-07-12| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:00&amp;nbsp;UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:45&amp;nbsp;UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;NJFunnel&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornado1&quot;/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (21:15&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author=Associated Press| date=2006-07-13| title=Westchester County Storm: Let The Clean-Up Begin| publisher=[[WCBS-TV]]| accessdate=2008-11-30|url=http://wcbstv.com/topstories/Tornado.Tornado.Warning.2.236314.html}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At around 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:30&amp;nbsp;UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]].

					==Impact==
					[[File:2006 Westchester County tornado forrest damage.jpg|thumb|right|Tornado damage near a [[forest]]ed area]]
					The tornado took a path through [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]], [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]], and [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield]] counties, downing or uprooting thousands of trees and damaging several structures, including significant structural damage to the [[California Closets]] warehouse. Six minor injuries were also reported. In all, the tornado inflicted $12.1&amp;nbsp;million in damage.&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt;

					Minor damage was reported in Rockland County. One dock and one boat were damaged by the tornado.&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; After crossing the [[Hudson River]], the tornado entered Westchester County, where the worst of the damage took place.

					The tornado took a path through [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]], [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]], and [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield]] counties, downing or uprooting thousands of trees and damaging several structures, including significant structural damage to the [[California Closets]] warehouse. Six minor injuries were also reported. In all, the tornado inflicted $12.1&amp;nbsp;million in damage.&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt;

					Minor damage was reported in Rockland County. One dock and one boat were damaged by the tornado.&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; After crossing the [[Hudson River]], the tornado entered Westchester County, where the worst of the damage took place.

					The &#x27;&#x27;&#x27;2006 Westchester County tornado&#x27;&#x27;&#x27; was the strongest and largest [[tornado]] in the history of [[Westchester County, New York]].&lt;ref name=&quot;THPWest&quot;/&gt; It touched down there on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006 and traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter.&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:03&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name=&quot;THPWest&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950-2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

					Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, and a large stained-glass window was shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted.

					[[File:July 12, 2006 Westchester Tornado.gif|thumb|left|[[Weather radar]] animation of the supercell that spawned the tornado at 3:45&amp;nbsp;pm EDT]]
					On July&amp;nbsp;12 a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornadowatch&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=2006-07-12| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:00&amp;nbsp;UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:45&amp;nbsp;UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;NJFunnel&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornado1&quot;/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (21:15&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author=Associated Press| date=2006-07-13| title=Westchester County Storm: Let The Clean-Up Begin| publisher=[[WCBS-TV]]| accessdate=2008-11-30|url=http://wcbstv.com/topstories/Tornado.Tornado.Warning.2.236314.html}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At around 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:30&amp;nbsp;UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]].

					==Impact==
					[[File:2006 Westchester County tornado forrest damage.jpg|thumb|right|Tornado damage near a [[forest]]ed area]]
					The tornado took a path through [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]], [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]], and [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield]] counties, downing or uprooting thousands of trees and damaging several structures, including significant structural damage to the [[California Closets]] warehouse. Six minor injuries were also reported. In all, the tornado inflicted $12.1&amp;nbsp;million in damage.&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt;

					Minor damage was reported in Rockland County. One dock and one boat were damaged by the tornado.&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; After crossing the [[Hudson River]], the tornado entered Westchester County, where the worst of the damage took place. It struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]], damaging roofs and tearing the siding off numerous homes and businesses.&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; A 10&amp;nbsp;foot (3&amp;nbsp;m) tall stained-glass window in the St. Teresa of Avila Church was shattered.&lt;ref name=&quot;USAT&quot;/&gt; Afterwards, the town of [[Pocantico Hills, New York|Pocantico Hills]] was struck as the tornado intensified to F2 intensity.

					The &#x27;&#x27;&#x27;2006 Westchester County tornado&#x27;&#x27;&#x27; was the strongest and largest [[tornado]] in the history of [[Westchester County, New York]].&lt;ref name=&quot;THPWest&quot;/&gt; It touched down there on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006 and traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at [[Fujita scale#Parameters|F1]] intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter.&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:03&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name=&quot;THPWest&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950-2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

					Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, and a large stained-glass window was shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted. There were no fatalities and only six minor injuries were associated with the storm. The cost of damages was estimated at $12.1&amp;nbsp;million.

					[[File:July 12, 2006 Westchester Tornado.gif|thumb|left|[[Weather radar]] animation of the supercell that spawned the tornado at 3:45&amp;nbsp;pm EDT]]
					On July&amp;nbsp;12 a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornadowatch&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=2006-07-12| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:00&amp;nbsp;UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:45&amp;nbsp;UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;NJFunnel&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornado1&quot;/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (21:15&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author=Associated Press| date=2006-07-13| title=Westchester County Storm: Let The Clean-Up Begin| publisher=[[WCBS-TV]]| accessdate=2008-11-30|url=http://wcbstv.com/topstories/Tornado.Tornado.Warning.2.236314.html}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At around 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:30&amp;nbsp;UTC), an [[Fujita scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]].

					==Impact==
					[[File:2006 Westchester County tornado forrest damage.jpg|thumb|right|Tornado damage near a [[forest]]ed area]]
					The tornado took a path through [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]], [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]], and [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield]] counties, downing or uprooting thousands of trees and damaging several structures, including significant structural damage to the [[California Closets]] warehouse. Six minor injuries were also reported. In all, the tornado inflicted $12.1&amp;nbsp;million in damage.&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt;

					Minor damage was reported in Rockland County. One dock and one boat were damaged by the tornado.&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; After crossing the [[Hudson River]], the tornado entered Westchester County, where the worst of the damage took place. It struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]], damaging roofs and tearing the siding off numerous homes and businesses.&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; A 10&amp;nbsp;foot (3&amp;nbsp;m) tall stained-glass window in the St. Teresa of Avila Church was shattered.&lt;ref name=&quot;USAT&quot;/&gt; Afterwards, the town of [[Pocantico Hills, New York|Pocantico Hills]] was struck as the tornado intensified to F2 intensity.

					The &#x27;&#x27;&#x27;2006 Westchester County tornado&#x27;&#x27;&#x27; was the strongest and largest [[tornado]] in the history of [[Westchester County, New York]].&lt;ref name=&quot;THPWest&quot;/&gt; It touched down there on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006 and traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at [[Fujita scale#Parameters|F1]] intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter.&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:03&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name=&quot;THPWest&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950-2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

					[[File:July 12, 2006 Westchester Tornado.gif|thumb|left|[[Weather radar]] animation of the supercell that spawned the tornado at 3:45&amp;nbsp;pm EDT]]
					On July&amp;nbsp;12 a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornadowatch&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=2006-07-12| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:00&amp;nbsp;UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:45&amp;nbsp;UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;NJFunnel&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornado1&quot;/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (21:15&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author=Associated Press| date=2006-07-13| title=Westchester County Storm: Let The Clean-Up Begin| publisher=[[WCBS-TV]]| accessdate=2008-11-30|url=http://wcbstv.com/topstories/Tornado.Tornado.Warning.2.236314.html}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At around 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:30&amp;nbsp;UTC), an [[Fujita scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]].

					The &#x27;&#x27;&#x27;2006 Westchester County tornado&#x27;&#x27;&#x27; was an F2 tornado that traveled through Westchester County, NY. It touched down there on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006 and traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at [[Fujita scale#Parameters|F1]] intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter.&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:03&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name=&quot;THPWest&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950-2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

					On July&amp;nbsp;12 a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]].

					On July&amp;nbsp;12 a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornadowatch&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=2006-07-12| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:00&amp;nbsp;UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:45&amp;nbsp;UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;NJFunnel&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornado1&quot;/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (21:15&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author=Associated Press| date=2006-07-13| title=Westchester County Storm: Let The Clean-Up Begin| publisher=[[WCBS-TV]]| accessdate=2008-11-30|url=http://wcbstv.com/topstories/Tornado.Tornado.Warning.2.236314.html}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At around 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:30&amp;nbsp;UTC), an [[Fujita scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]].

					The &#x27;&#x27;&#x27;2006 Westchester County tornado&#x27;&#x27;&#x27; was the strongest and largest [[tornado]] in the history of [[Westchester County, New York]].&lt;ref name=&quot;THPWest&quot;/&gt; It touched down there on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006 and traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at [[Fujita scale#Parameters|F1]] intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter.&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:03&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name=&quot;THPWest&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950–2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

					[[File:July 12, 2006 Westchester Tornado.gif|thumb|left|[[Weather radar]] animation of the supercell that spawned the tornado at 3:45&amp;nbsp;pm EDT]]
					On July&amp;nbsp;12 a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornadowatch&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=2006-07-12| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:00&amp;nbsp;UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:45&amp;nbsp;UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;NJFunnel&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York (state)|New York]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornado1&quot;/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (21:15&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author=Associated Press| date=2006-07-13| title=Westchester County Storm: Let The Clean-Up Begin| publisher=[[WCBS-TV]]| accessdate=2008-11-30|url=http://wcbstv.com/topstories/Tornado.Tornado.Warning.2.236314.html}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At around 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:30&amp;nbsp;UTC), an [[Fujita scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]].

					[[File:July 12, 2006 Westchester Tornado.gif|thumb|left|[[Weather radar]] animation of the supercell that spawned the tornado at 3:45&amp;nbsp;pm EDT]]
					On July&amp;nbsp;12 a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornadowatch&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=2006-07-12| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:00&amp;nbsp;UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:45&amp;nbsp;UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;NJFunnel&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York (state)|New York]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornado1&quot;/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (21:15&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author=Associated Press| date=2006-07-13| title=Westchester County Storm: Let The Clean-Up Begin| publisher=[[WCBS-TV]]| accessdate=2008-11-30|url=http://wcbstv.com/topstories/Tornado.Tornado.Warning.2.236314.html}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At around 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:30&amp;nbsp;UTC), an [[Fujita scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]].

					The tornado took a path through [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]], [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]], and [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield]] counties, downing or uprooting thousands of trees and damaging several structures, including significant structural damage to the [[California Closets]] warehouse. Six minor injuries were also reported. In all, the tornado inflicted $12.1&amp;nbsp;million in damage.&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt;

					The &#x27;&#x27;&#x27;2006 Westchester County tornado&#x27;&#x27;&#x27; was the strongest and largest [[tornado]] in the history of [[Westchester County, New York]].&lt;ref name=&quot;THPWest&quot;/&gt; It touched down there on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006 and traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at [[Fujita scale#Parameters|F1]] intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter.&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:03&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name=&quot;THPWest&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950–2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

					[[File:July 12, 2006 Westchester Tornado.gif|thumb|left|[[Weather radar]] animation of the supercell that spawned the tornado at 3:45&amp;nbsp;pm EDT]]
					On July&amp;nbsp;12 a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornadowatch&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=2006-07-12| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:00&amp;nbsp;UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:45&amp;nbsp;UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;NJFunnel&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York (state)|New York]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornado1&quot;/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (21:15&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author=Associated Press| date=2006-07-13| title=Westchester County Storm: Let The Clean-Up Begin| publisher=[[WCBS-TV]]| accessdate=2008-11-30|url=http://wcbstv.com/topstories/Tornado.Tornado.Warning.2.236314.html}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At around 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:30&amp;nbsp;UTC), an [[Fujita scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]].

					==Meteorological synopsis==
					[[File:July 12, 2006 Westchester Tornado.gif|thumb|left|[[Weather radar]] animation of the supercell that spawned the tornado at 3:45&amp;nbsp;pm EDT]]
					On July&amp;nbsp;12 a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornadowatch&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=2006-07-12| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:00&amp;nbsp;UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:45&amp;nbsp;UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;NJFunnel&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York (state)|New York]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornado1&quot;/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (21:15&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author=Associated Press| date=2006-07-13| title=Westchester County Storm: Let The Clean-Up Begin| publisher=[[WCBS-TV]]| accessdate=2008-11-30|url=http://wcbstv.com/topstories/Tornado.Tornado.Warning.2.236314.html}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At around 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:30&amp;nbsp;UTC), an [[Fujita scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]].

					[[File:2006 Westchester County tornado forrest damage.jpg|thumb|right|Tornado damage near a [[forest]]ed area]]
					The tornado took a path through [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]], [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]], and [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield]] counties, downing or uprooting thousands of trees and damaging several structures, including significant structural damage to the [[California Closets]] warehouse. Six minor injuries were also reported. In all, the tornado inflicted $12.1&amp;nbsp;million in damage.&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt;

					The &#x27;&#x27;&#x27;2006 Westchester County tornado&#x27;&#x27;&#x27; was the strongest and largest [[tornado]] in [[Westchester County, New York]] since the [[1904 Chappaqua tornado]]. It touched down there on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006 and traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at [[Fujita scale#Parameters|F1]] intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter.&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:03&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name=&quot;THPWest&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950–2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

					Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, and a large stained-glass window was shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted. There were no fatalities and only six minor injuries were associated with the storm. The cost of damages was estimated at $12.1&amp;nbsp;million.

					On July&amp;nbsp;12 a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]].

					The &#x27;&#x27;&#x27;2006 Westchester County tornado&#x27;&#x27;&#x27; was the strongest and largest [[tornado]] in [[Westchester County, New York]] since the [[1904 Chappaqua tornado]]. It touched down there on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006 and traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at [[Fujita scale#Parameters|F1]] intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter.&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:03&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name=&quot;THPWest&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950–2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

					[[File:July 12, 2006 Westchester Tornado.gif|thumb|left|[[Weather radar]] animation of the supercell that spawned the tornado at 3:45&amp;nbsp;pm EDT]]
					On July&amp;nbsp;12 a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornadowatch&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=2006-07-12| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:00&amp;nbsp;UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:45&amp;nbsp;UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;NJFunnel&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York (state)|New York]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornado1&quot;/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (21:15&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author=Associated Press| date=2006-07-13| title=Westchester County Storm: Let The Clean-Up Begin| publisher=[[WCBS-TV]]| accessdate=2008-11-30|url=http://wcbstv.com/topstories/Tornado.Tornado.Warning.2.236314.html}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At around 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:30&amp;nbsp;UTC), an [[Fujita scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]].

					The tornado took a path through [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]], [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]], and [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield]] counties, downing or uprooting thousands of trees and damaging several structures, including significant structural damage to the California Closets warehouse. Six minor injuries were also reported. In all, the tornado inflicted $12.1&amp;nbsp;million in damage.&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt;

					The &#x27;&#x27;&#x27;2006 Westchester County tornado&#x27;&#x27;&#x27; was the strongest and largest [[tornado]] in [[Westchester County, New York]] since the [[1904 Chappaqua tornado]]. It touched down there on July 12, 2006 and traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at [[Fujita scale#Parameters|F1]] intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter.&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:03&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name=&quot;THPWest&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950–2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=December 6, 2008|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

					Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, and a large stained-glass window was shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted.

					[[File:July 12, 2006 Westchester Tornado.gif|thumb|left|[[Weather radar]] animation of the supercell that spawned the tornado at 3:45&amp;nbsp;pm EDT]]
					On July 12 a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]].

					The &#x27;&#x27;&#x27;2006 Westchester County tornado&#x27;&#x27;&#x27; was the strongest and largest [[tornado]] in [[Westchester County, New York]] since the [[1904 Chappaqua tornado]]. It touched down there on July 12, 2006 and traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at [[Fujita scale#Parameters|F1]] intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter.&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:03&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name=&quot;THPWest&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950–2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=December 6, 2008|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

					[[File:July 12, 2006 Westchester Tornado.gif|thumb|left|[[Weather radar]] animation of the supercell that spawned the tornado at 3:45&amp;nbsp;pm EDT]]
					On July 12 a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornadowatch&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=July 12, 2006| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=November 29, 2008|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:00&amp;nbsp;UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:45&amp;nbsp;UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;NJFunnel&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=November 29, 2008| url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York (state)|New York]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornado1&quot;/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (21:15&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author=Associated Press| date=July 13, 2006| title=Westchester County Storm: Let The Clean-Up Begin| publisher=[[WCBS-TV]]| accessdate=November 30, 2008|url=http://wcbstv.com/topstories/Tornado.Tornado.Warning.2.236314.html}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At around 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:30&amp;nbsp;UTC), an [[Fujita scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]].
