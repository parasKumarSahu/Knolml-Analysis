b'Abhinavagupta (c. 950 \xe2\x80\x93 1016 CE) was a philosopher, mystic and aesthetician from Kashmir.  He was also considered an influential musician, poet, dramatist, exegete, theologian, and logician \xe2\x80\x93 a polymathic personality who exercised strong influences on Indian culture.He was born in Kashmiri Brahmin family of scholars and mystics and studied all the schools of philosophy and art of his time under the guidance of as many as fifteen (or more) teachers and gurus. In his long life he completed over 35 works, the largest and most famous of which is Tantr\xc4\x81loka, an encyclopedic treatise on all the philosophical and practical aspects of Kaula and Trika (known today as Kashmir Shaivism). Another one of his very important contributions was in the field of philosophy of aesthetics with his famous Abhinavabh\xc4\x81rat\xc4\xab commentary of N\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadya\xc5\x9b\xc4\x81stra of Bharata Muni.\n\nLife\n"Abhinavagupta" was not his real name, rather a title he earned from his master, carrying a meaning of "competence and authoritativeness". In his analysis, Jayaratha (1150\xe2\x80\x931200 AD) \xe2\x80\x93 who was Abhinavagupta\'s most important commentator \xe2\x80\x93 also reveals three more meanings: "being ever vigilant", "being present everywhere" and "protected by praises". Raniero Gnoli, the only Sanskrit scholar who completed a translation of Tantr\xc4\x81loka in a European language, mentions that "Abhinava" also means "new", as a reference to the ever-new creative force of his mystical experience.\nFrom Jayaratha, we learn that Abhinavagupta was in possession of all the six qualities required for the recipients of the tremendous level of \xc5\x9baktip\xc4\x81ta, as described in the sacred texts (\xc5\x9ar\xc4\xabp\xc5\xabrva\xc5\x9b\xc4\x81stra): an unflinching faith in God, realisation of mantras, control over objective principles (referring to the 36 tattvas), successful conclusion of all the activities undertaken, poetic creativity and spontaneous knowledge of all disciplines.Abhinavagupta\'s creation is well equilibrated between the branches of the triad (Trika): will (icch\xc4\x81), knowledge (j\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na), action (kriy\xc4\x81); his works also include devotional songs, academical/philosophical works and works describing ritual/yogic practices.As an author, he is considered a systematiser of the philosophical thought. He reconstructed, rationalised and orchestrated the philosophical knowledge into a more coherent form, assessing all the available sources of his time, not unlike a modern scientific researcher of Indology.\nVarious contemporary scholars have characterised Abhinavagupta as a "brilliant scholar and saint", "the pinnacle of the development of Kasmir \xc5\x9aaivism" and "in possession of yogic realization".\n\nSocial background, family and disciples\n"Magical" birth\nThe term by which Abhinavagupta himself defines his origin is "yogin\xc4\xabbh\xc5\xab", \'born of a yogin\xc4\xab\'. In Kashmir Shaivism and especially in Kaula it is considered that a progeny of parents "established in the divine essence of Bhairava", is endowed with exceptional spiritual and intellectual prowess. Such a child is supposed to be "the depository of knowledge", who "even as a child in the womb, has the form of Shiva", to enumerate but a few of the classical attributes of his kind.\n\nParents\nAbhinavagupta was born in a Kashmiri Brahmin family. His mother, Vimal\xc4\x81 (Vimalakal\xc4\x81) died when Abhinavagupta was just two years old; as a consequence of losing his mother, of whom he was reportedly very attached, he grew more distant from worldly life and focused all the more on spiritual endeavour.\nThe father, Narasi\xe1\xb9\x83ha Gupta, after his wife\'s death favoured an ascetic lifestyle, while raising his three children. He had a cultivated mind and a heart "outstandingly adorned with devotion to Mahesvara (Shiva)" (in Abhinavagupta\'s own words). He was Abhinavagupta\'s first teacher, instructing him in grammar, logic and literature.\n\nFamily\nAbhinavagupta had a brother and a sister. The brother, Manoratha, was a well-versed devotee of Shiva. His sister, Amb\xc4\x81 (probable name, according to Navjivan Rastogi), devoted herself to worship after the death of her husband in late life.\nHis cousin Kar\xe1\xb9\x87a demonstrated even from his youth that he grasped the essence of \xc5\x9aaivism and was detached of the world. His wife was presumably Abhinavagupta\'s older sister Amb\xc4\x81, who looked with reverence upon her illustrious brother. Amb\xc4\x81 and Kar\xe1\xb9\x87a had a son, Yoge\xc5\x9bvaridatta, who was precociously talented in yoga (yoge\xc5\x9bvar implies "lord of yoga").\nAbhinavagupta also mentions his disciple R\xc4\x81madeva as faithfully devoted to scriptural study and serving his master. Another cousin was K\xe1\xb9\xa3ema, possibly the same as Abhinavagupta\'s illustrious disciple K\xe1\xb9\xa3emar\xc4\x81ja. Mandra, a childhood friend of Kar\xe1\xb9\x87a, was their host in a suburban residence; he was not only rich and in possession of a pleasing personality, but also equally learned. And last but not least, Vatasik\xc4\x81, Mandra\'s aunt, who got a special mention from Abhinavagupta for caring for him with exceptional dedication and concern; to express his gratitude, Abhinavagupta declared that Vatasik\xc4\x81 deserved the credit for the successful completion of his work.The emerging picture here is that Abhinavagupta lived in a nurturing and protected environment, where his creative energies got all the support they required. Everyone around him was filled with spiritual fervor and had taken Abhinavagupta as their spiritual master. Such a supporting group of family and friends was equally necessary as his personal qualities of genius, to complete a work of the magnitude of Tantr\xc4\x81loka.\n\nAncestors\nBy Abhinavagupta\'s own account, his most remote known ancestor was called Atrigupta, born in Madhyade\xc5\x9ba: [Manusmirti (circa 1500 BC, 2/21) defines the Madhyadesh region as vast plains between Himalaya and Vindhya mountains and to the east of the river Vinasana (invisible Saraswati) and to the west of Praya]. Born in Madhyade\xc5\x9ba he travelled to Kashmir at the request of the king Lalit\xc4\x81ditya, around year 740 CE.\n\nMasters\nAbhinavagupta is famous for his voracious thirst for knowledge. To study he took many teachers (as many as 15), both mystical philosophers and scholars. He approached Vai\xe1\xb9\xa3\xe1\xb9\x87avas, Buddhists, \xc5\x9aiddh\xc4\x81nta \xc5\x9aaivists and the Trika scholars.\nAmong the most prominent of his teachers, he enumerates four. V\xc4\x81man\xc4\x81tha who instructed him in dualistic \xc5\x9aaivism and Bh\xc5\xabtir\xc4\x81ja in the dualist/nondualist school. Besides being the teacher of the famous Abhinavagupta, Bh\xc5\xabtir\xc4\x81ja was also the father of two eminent scholars.Lak\xe1\xb9\xa3ma\xe1\xb9\x87agupta, a direct disciple of Utpaladeva, in the lineage of Trayambaka, was highly respected by Abhinavagupta and taught him all the schools of monistic thought : Krama, Trika and Pratyabhij\xc3\xb1a (except Kula).\xc5\x9aambhun\xc4\x81tha taught him the fourth school (Ardha-trayambaka). This school is in fact Kaula, and it was emanated from Trayambaka\'s daughter.\nFor Abhinavagupta, \xc5\x9aambhun\xc4\x81tha was the most admired guru. Describing the greatness of his master, he compared \xc5\x9aambhun\xc4\x81tha with the Sun, in his power to dispel ignorance from the heart, and, in another place, with "the Moon shining over the ocean of Trika knowledge".Abhinavagupta received Kaula initiation through \xc5\x9aambhun\xc4\x81thas wife (acting as a d\xc5\xabt\xc4\xab or conduit). The energy of this initiation is transmitted and sublimated into the heart and finally into consciousness. Such a method is difficult but very rapid and is reserved for those who shed their mental limitations and are pure.\nIt was \xc5\x9aambhun\xc4\x81tha who requested of him to write Tantr\xc4\x81loka. As guru, he had a profound influence in the structure of Tantr\xc4\x81loka and in the life of its creator, Abhinavagupta.As many as twelve more of his principal teachers are enumerated by name but without details. It is believed that Abhinavagupta had more secondary teachers. Moreover, during his life he had accumulated a large number of texts from which he quoted in his magnum opus, in his desire to create a synthetic, all-inclusive system, where the contrasts of different scriptures could be resolved by integration into a superior perspective.\n\nLifestyle\nAbhinavagupta remained unmarried all his life, and as an adept of Kaula, at least initially maintained brahmacharya and supposedly used the vital force of his energy (ojas) to deepen his understanding of the spiritual nervous system he outlined in his works\xe2\x80\x94a system involving ritual union between Purusha as (Shiva) and Shakti. Such union is essentially non-physical and universal, and thus Abhinavagupta conceived himself as always in communion with Shiva-Shakti. In the context of his life and teachings, Abhinavagupta parallels Shiva as both ascetic and enjoyer.\nHe studied assiduously at least until the age of 30 or 35,. To accomplish that he travelled, mostly inside Kashmir. By his own testimony, he had attained spiritual liberation through his Kaula practice, under the guidance of his most admired master, \xc5\x9aambhun\xc4\x81tha.He lived in his home (functioning as an ashram) with his family members and disciples, and he did not become a wandering monk, nor did he take on the regular duties of his family, but lived out his life as a writer and a teacher. His personality was described as a living realisation of his vision.In an epoch pen-painting he is depicted seated in Virasana, surrounded by devoted disciples and family, performing a kind of trance-inducing music at veena while dictating verses of Tantr\xc4\x81loka to one of his attendees \xe2\x80\x93 behind him two d\xc5\xabt\xc4\xab (women yogi) waiting on him. A legend about the moment of his death (placed somewhere between 1015 and 1025, depending on the source), says that he took with him 1,200 disciples and marched off to a cave (the Bhairava Cave, an actual place known to this day), reciting his poem Bhairava-stava, a devotional work. They were never to be seen again, supposedly translating together into the spiritual world.\n\nWorks\nAbhinavagupta\'s works fall into multiple sections: manuals of religious ritual, devotional songs, philosophical works and philosophy of aesthetics. Here are enumerated most of his works. Bold type faced titles represent the most important ones.\n\nReligious works\nTantraloka\nHis most important work was Tantr\xc4\x81loka,(translates into  "To Throw Light on Tantra"), a synthesis of all the Trika system. Its only complete translation in a European language \xe2\x80\x93 Italian \xe2\x80\x93 is credited to Raniero Gnoli, now at its second edition. The esoteric chapter 29 on the Kaula ritual was translated in English together with Jayaratha\'s commentary by John R. Dupuche, Rev. Dr. A complex study on the context, authors, contents and references of Tantr\xc4\x81loka was published by Navjivan Rastogi, Prof. of the Lucknow University. Though there are no English translations of Tantr\xc4\x81loka to date, the last recognized master of the oral tradition of Kashmir Shaivism, Swami Lakshman Joo, gave a condensed version of the important philosophical chapters of \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98Tantr\xc4\x81loka\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x98 in his book, Kashmir Shaivism \xe2\x80\x93 The Secret Supreme.Another important text was the commentary on Par\xc4\x81tr\xc4\xab\xc5\x9bik\xc4\x81, Par\xc4\x81tr\xc4\xab\xc5\x9bik\xc4\x81vivara\xe1\xb9\x87a, detailing the signification of the phonematic energies and their two sequential ordering systems, M\xc4\x81t\xe1\xb9\x9bk\xc4\x81 and M\xc4\x81lin\xc4\xab. This was the last great translation project of Jaideva Singh.\n\nTantrasara\nTantras\xc4\x81ra ("Essence of Tantra") is a summarised version, in prose, of Tantr\xc4\x81loka, which was once more summarised in Tantroccaya, and finally presented in a very short summary form under the name of Tantrava\xe1\xb9\xadadh\xc4\x81nik\xc4\x81 \xe2\x80\x93 the "Seed of Tantra".\nP\xc5\xabrvapa\xc3\xb1cik\xc4\x81 was a commentary of P\xc5\xabrvatantra, alias M\xc4\x81lin\xc4\xabvijaya Tantra, lost to this day. M\xc4\x81lin\xc4\xabvijay\xc4\x81-varttika ("Commentary on M\xc4\x81lin\xc4\xabvijaya") is a versified commentary on M\xc4\x81lin\xc4\xabvijaya Tantra\'s first verse. Kramakeli, "Krama\'s Play" was a commentary of Kramastotra, now lost. Bhagavadg\xc4\xabt\xc4\x81rtha-sa\xe1\xb9\x83graha which translates "Commentary on Bhagavad Gita" has now an English translation by Boris Marjanovic.Other religious works are: Par\xc4\x81tr\xc4\xab\xc5\x9bik\xc4\x81-laghuv\xe1\xb9\x9btti, "A Short Commentary on Par\xc4\x81tr\xc4\xab\xc5\x9bik\xc4\x81", Paryantapa\xc3\xb1c\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b\xc4\xabk\xc4\x81 ("Fifty Verses on the Ultimate Reality"), Rahasyapa\xc3\xb1cada\xc5\x9bik\xc4\x81 ("Fifteen Verses on the Mystical Doctrine"), Laghv\xc4\xab prakriy\xc4\x81 ("Short Ceremony"), Dev\xc4\xabstotravivara\xe1\xb9\x87a ("Commentary on the Hymn to Devi") and Param\xc4\x81rthas\xc4\x81ra ("Essence of the Supreme Reality").\n\nDevotional hymns\nAbhinavagupta has composed a number of devotional poems, most of which have been translated into French by Lilian Silburn:\nBodhapa\xc3\xb1cada\xc5\x9bik\xc4\x81 \xe2\x80\x93 "Fifteen Verses on Consciousness";\nParam\xc4\x81rthacarc\xc4\x81 \xe2\x80\x93 "Discussion on the Supreme Reality";\nAnubhavanivedana \xe2\x80\x93 "Tribute of the Inner Experience";\nAnuttar\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xa3\xe1\xb9\xadik\xc4\x81 \xe2\x80\x93 "Eight Verses on Anuttara";\nKrama-stotra \xe2\x80\x93 an hymn, different from the fundamental text of the Krama school;\nBhairava-stava \xe2\x80\x93 "Hymn to Bhairava";\nDehasthadevat\xc4\x81cakra-stotra \xe2\x80\x93 "Hymn to the Wheel of Divinities that Live in the Body";\nParam\xc4\x81rthadv\xc4\x81da\xc5\x9bik\xc4\x81 \xe2\x80\x93 "Twelve Verses on the Supreme Reality" and\nMahopade\xc5\x9ba-vi\xe1\xb9\x83\xc5\x9batik\xc4\x81 \xe2\x80\x93 "Twenty Verses on the Great Teaching".\nAnother poem \xc5\x9aiva\xc5\x9baktyavin\xc4\x81bh\xc4\x81va-stotra \xe2\x80\x93 "Hymn on the Inseparability of Shiva and Shakti" was lost.\n\nPhilosophical works\nOne of the most important works of Abhinavagupta is \xc4\xaa\xc5\x9bvarapratyabhij\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81-vimar\xc5\x9bini ("Commentary to the Verses on the Recognition of the Lord") and \xc4\xaa\xc5\x9bvarapratyabhij\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81-viv\xe1\xb9\x9bti-vimar\xc5\x9bini ("Commentary on the explanation of \xc4\xaa\xc5\x9bvarapratyabhij\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81"). This treatise is fundamental in the transmission of the Pratyabhij\xc3\xb1a school (the branch of Kashmir Shaivism based on direct recognition of the Lord) to our days. Another commentary on a Pratyabhij\xc3\xb1a work \xe2\x80\x93 \xc5\x9aivad\xe1\xb9\x9b\xe1\xb9\xa3ty\xc4\x81-locana ("Light on \xc5\x9aivad\xe1\xb9\x9b\xe1\xb9\xa3\xe1\xb9\xadi") \xe2\x80\x93 is now lost. Another lost commentary is Pad\xc4\x81rthaprave\xc5\x9ba-nir\xe1\xb9\x87aya-\xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\xabk\xc4\x81 and Prak\xc4\xabr\xe1\xb9\x87kavivara\xe1\xb9\x87a ("Comment on the Notebook") referring to the third chapter of V\xc4\x81kyapad\xc4\xabya of Bhartrihari. Two more philosophical texts of Abhinavagupta are Kath\xc4\x81mukha-tilaka("Ornament of the Face of Discourses") and Bhedav\xc4\x81da-vid\xc4\x81ra\xe1\xb9\x87a ("Confrontation of the Dualist Thesis"). Abhinavagupta\'s thought was strongly influenced by Buddhist logic.\n\nPoetical and dramatic works\nAbhinavaguptas most important work on the philosophy of art is Abhinavabh\xc4\x81rat\xc4\xab \xe2\x80\x93 a long and complex commentary on Natya Shastra of Bharata Muni. This work has been one of the most important factors contributing to Abhinavagupta\'s fame up until present day. His most important contribution was that to the theory of rasa (aesthetic savour).\nOther poetical works include: Gha\xe1\xb9\xada-karpara-kulaka-viv\xe1\xb9\x9bti, a commentary on "Gha\xe1\xb9\xadakarpara" of Kalidasa; K\xc4\x81vyakau\xe1\xb9\xadukavivara\xe1\xb9\x87a, a "Commentary to the Wonder of Poetry" (a work of Bha\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xada Tauta), now lost; and Dhvany\xc4\x81lokalocana, "Illustration of Dhvany\xc4\x81loka", which is a famous work of Anandavardhana.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nBibliography of Abhinavagupta\'s works, Item 582, Karl Potter, University of Washington\nMuktabodha Online Library \xe2\x80\x93 containing many of Abhinavagupta\'s works in Sanskrit including Tantr\xc4\x81loka\nGRETIL: a collection of Abhinavagupta\'s works in original, also containing other Kashmir Shaivism texts\nFour biographical articles on Abhinavagupta by Swami Lakshman Joo, Prof. K.
