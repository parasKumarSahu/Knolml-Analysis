b"The Airbus RACER (Rapid and Cost-Effective Rotorcraft) is an experimental high-speed compound helicopter developed by Airbus Helicopters from the Eurocopter X\xc2\xb3.\nRevealed at the June 2017 Paris air show, final assembly will start in 2019 for a 2020 first flight.\nCruising up to 400 km/h (216 kn), it aims for a 25% cost reduction per distance over a conventional helicopter.\n\nDevelopment\nOn 20 June 2017 at the Paris air show, Airbus Helicopters revealed a high-speed demonstrator configuration based on the X3.\nDeveloped within the Clean Sky 2 research programme, final assembly will start in 2019 for a 2020 first flight.\nIts aerodynamic configuration was validated in 2017.\nIn February 2018, the 2,500 hp (1,900 kW) Safran Aneto-1X was preferred over the RTM322 initially selected, it is 25% more compact for the same power.By October 2018, design of key subsystems was completed before the first components started manufacturing with long-lead items, as the lateral drive shaft production began.\nGE's Avio Aero in Italy launched procurement and manufacturing of the lateral gear boxes housings, GE Aviation Systems in UK is building the wing\xe2\x80\x99s titanium cradle, INCAS/Romaero in Romania started manufacturing the composite side panel and Aernnova in Spain the tail parts primary structure.\nFinal assembly in Q4 2019 will precede the 2020 flight demonstration, including 200 flight hours.\nIt will open the flight envelope and assess performance, before demonstrating missions like EMS, SAR and private transport, maturing low-noise flight procedures.\n\nDesign\nOptimised for a cruise over 400 km/h (216 kn), 50% faster than a conventional helicopter, it will consume 15% less fuel per distance at 180 kn (333 km/h) than an helicopter at 130 kn (241 km/h), and aim for a 25% cost reduction per distance.\nThe lateral pusher propellers generate thrust and are isolated from passengers during ground operations by the box wings which serve to generate lift at cruise velocity, this allows the main rotor to be slowed by up to 15% as the craft's air speed increases and prevents the rotor blades breaking the sound barrier which would reduce performance.\nDriven by two engines capable of shutting down and restarting once inflight to save fuel and increase range, it will have a low weight and low maintenance hybrid metallic-composite airframe and lower weight high voltage direct current electrical generation.\n\nSee also\n\nFairey Rotodyne\nSikorsky S-97Related development\n\nEurocopter X\xc2\xb3Aircraft of comparable role, configuration and era\n\nKamov Ka-92\nPiasecki X-49\nSikorsky X2\nRelated lists\n\nList of rotorcraft\n\n\n== References =="
