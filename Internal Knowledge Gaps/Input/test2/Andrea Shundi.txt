b'Andrea Shundi (born 15 November 1934) is an Albanian-American agronomist of the 20th and 21st century. His academic research and publications focus mainly on the forage systems as a source feeding of the livestock, on viticulture and viniculture, and also on the history of the Albanian agriculture.\nOne of the main authors of university level textbooks in Albania and lecturer and then dean at the Faculty of Agriculture of the Agricultural University of Tirana, Shundi has also been an active participant in many international conferences and symposia on forage systems and viticulture. He has often lectured in Italian and Greek agricultural universities as a guest. Along Mentor P\xc3\xabrmeti he has been the organizer of the first pan Albanian conference on Agriculture scientific work in 1975 and in 1991 he was the organizer of the second and last conference of that level.\n\nLife and works\nEarly years and scientific work in Albania\nAndrea Shundi was born on November 15, 1934, in Tirana, Albania. After finishing high school in his native city, he attended the Agricultural University of Tirana, where he pursued studies in Agronomy and graduated in 1956. From 1956 to 1960 Shundi was a researcher at the Institute of Agricultural Research in Lushnje. In 1960-1962 he was chief agronomist of the Agricultural Cooperative of Krutje, Lushnje, and in 1962-1964 he was Chief Agronomist  of the Agricultural Department of the Lushnje District. During the 1956-1964 period he conducted experiments and published studies on the periods, depth, and tillage methods for the main types of the arable lands and for each climatic zone of Albania. At that time Shundi was also basketball as well as volleyball player/coach of the polisports\' club of the city of Lushnja, KS Traktori, which then played in the respective Albanian Basketball League and the Albanian Volleyball Leagues, the highest national divisions.During the 1964-1975 period Shundi was Director of the Livestock Feeds, Field Crops and Scientific Research Department in the Ministry of Agriculture of Albania. In this period Shundi\'s research work focused on forage systems, used for a coordinated development of the sources of the forage crop production. The main objective of the forage systems is the natural integration of all the forage sources of feeding the livestock: the annual and perennial plants of the arable lands, the forage crops, the forest and fruit trees, and shrubs. Shundi introduced the forage systems in his monograph, the Bim\xc3\xabt Foragjere n\xc3\xab Zon\xc3\xabn e Ftoht\xc3\xab (English: Forage Crops in Cold Climates), which was published in Tirana in 1974. A much larger republication of the book was done 30 years later, in 2004.\nFrom 1975 to 1976 Shundi was director of the Agriculture Department of the Kuk\xc3\xabs District, and during the 1976-1980 period he was the director of the Seed Enterprise of Tirana. In 1980-1992 he was first a professor, and then dean of the Agricultural Faculty of the Agricultural University of Tirana. During this period the main research of Shundi focused on the coordination of plant cultivation (Albanian: bashk\xc3\xabrendim i kulturave bujq\xc3\xabsore) and consociation of plant cultivation (Albanian: bashk\xc3\xabshoq\xc3\xabrim i kulturave bujq\xc3\xabsore) A third concept was introduced by Shundi in the Albanian agriculture, the Coefficient of Land Usage (CLU) (Albanian: Koefi\xc3\xa7enti i p\xc3\xabrdorimit t\xc3\xab tok\xc3\xabs), which is a measuring indicator that determines the degree of intensity of use of agricultural land through plant cultivation. The CLU includes units of mass, area, money, and time (usually ton per ha/$/days) and is used for both the coordination and the consociation of plant cultivation.\nDuring 1994-1998 he was scientific secretary of the Natural and Technical Sciences Section of the Academy of Sciences of Albania.\n\nMigration to the United States and work (1998-present)\nShundi retired from the Academy of Sciences in 1998, and migrated to the United States where he became a citizen. There he continued to write books on the forage systems with the Albanian peculiarities, but also started to focus on the history of the Albanian agriculture on the whole, and the Albanian viticulture and viniculture in particular.In his writings Shundi describes the history of the Albanian agriculture, which is a main part of the history of the Albanian people. His book, Bujq\xc3\xabsia dhe Veprimi Agronomik n\xc3\xab Troje Shqiptare (2001) (English: Agriculture and Agronomic Activity in Albanian lands), was the first historical book ever published on the history of the Albanian agriculture. The books chronologically focuses from the Neolithic Age until the 20th century. Shundi\'s second book on the history of the Albanian agriculture, Historia e Bujq\xc3\xabsis\xc3\xab dhe Agroindustris\xc3\xab Shqiptare (2003) (English: History of the Albanian Agriculture and Agroindustry) focuses on Medieval, Ottoman Albania, and Albanian National Awakening period, encompassing a period from the 6th to the 19th centuries. Another chapter of the book, written by Shundi, covers the history of agricultural education and scientific research in Albania. His third book on the history of the Albanian agriculture, Jet\xc3\xab Agronomike (2004) (English: Agronomic Life), focuses on the history of Albanian agriculture in the second half of the 20th century. Professor Velesin Pe\xc3\xa7uli, then Rector of the Agricultural University of Tirana prefaced the book where he points out rigorous scientific work of Shundi.After 10 monographs on the forage crops, in 2004 Shundi published the Bim\xc3\xabt Foragjere n\xc3\xab Zon\xc3\xabn e Ftoht\xc3\xab.(English: Forage Crops in Cold Climates). The book is accompanied by a technical explanatory vocabulary of key words and technical terms.\nFrom 2001 to 2010 Shundi also published 6 books on viticulture and viniculture. Vreshtaria Praktike.(English: Practical Viticulture), published in 2001, was praised in its preface by Italian academic Eugenio Sartori as a good omen for the Albanian viticulture, which has a long tradition. The book was followed by another publication, in 2004, Vreshtaria dhe Ver\xc3\xabtaria Shqiptare, (English: Albanian Viti-Viniculture), which was prefaced by Albanian professor, Moikom Zeqo. Zeqo calls the book a synthesis of both an old and a young mentality for the viticulture and viniculture. In addition, he describes the book as a testimony to the Albanian culture on wine, as a subtract of a larger Mediterranean wine culture. The book is in Albanian with a partial translation into English. In 2006 Shundi published Fjalor Shtjellues p\xc3\xabr Vreshtarin\xc3\xab dhe Ver\xc3\xabtarin\xc3\xab.(English: Explanatory Vocabulary of Viti-Viniculture), prefaced by the Albanian linguist, head of the coordinating group of the Albanian Encyclopaedia, Emil Lafe, who praises the book as a mature work that spans on the linguistic side as well as on the Agricultural one. The book includes terms and proverbs used in  Arvanitic, Cham language, and Arb\xc3\xabresh\xc3\xab, as well as terms in Gheg Albanian, which are not commonly used in today\'s Albanian, and thus attempts to include all the linguistic riches of the Albanian language.In 2008 Shundi published Prodhimi Sht\xc3\xabpiak i Rrushit dhe Ver\xc3\xabs  (English: Homemade production of Grape and Wine), prefaced by well known Albanian professor Aleko Minga, who described the book as a great means of diffusion of the Albanian agricultural culture. In 2010 Shundi published two additional books, Fjalor Enciklopedik per Vreshtarin\xc3\xab dhe Ver\xc3\xabtarin\xc3\xab (English: Encyclopedic Dictionary of Viti-Viniculture), prefaced by Prof. Resmi Osmani. The following book, called Vreshta dhe Kantina Shqiptare, (English: Albanian Wineyards and Cellars), includes a description of the most successful Albanian vineyards and cantines in Albanian, Kosovo, Macedonia, and Montenegro.\nShundi is widely cited by his peers such as by Lush Susaj, Professor at the Agricultural University of Tirana, Vineyards Cultivation, Tirana 2009, Kosovan professor and academic Latif Susuri Dictionary: Plants, Parasytes, Pathogens Prishtina 2005, Dictionary of Agricultural and Forestry Plants, and Weeds, Prishtina 2006, Professor Fatmir Voci in his Practices of Viticulture, 2007 (FAO Project), and Velesin Peculi in his Organic Agriculture Tirana 2005.\n\nAgricultural Conferences Organizer\nShundi has been an organizer and coordinator of 11 national meetings on the agricultural science. Along with academic Mentor P\xc3\xabrmeti he organized in 1975 an Albanian National Conference on Agricultural Sciences. Shundi organized a second national conference of this dimension 1991, called Agriculture under the new economical Developments in Albania, and focused on the major economic transformations of the Albanian agriculture following the transitory period of the History of post-Communist Albania.\nIn addition to these major conferences dedicated to the Albanian agriculture as a whole, Shundi also organized every year 9 pan-Albanian conferences on viticulture and viniculture in Albania and Kosovo in the 2001-2010 period.\n\nParticipation in International Congresses\nShundi took papers in the following international congresses and symposia:\n\nFive professional delegations of Albania at the Food and Agriculture Organization\'s General World or European meetings (in 1973, 1980, 1981, 1985, and 1987).\nSymposium of the Italian Association of the Agronomy (Potenza Italy, 1991)\nSymposium of the European Network of the Food and Agriculture Organization (Nitra, Slovakia, 1992)\nInternational Symposium on forages organized by the Mediterranean Agronomic Institute (Bari Italy, 1992)\nSymposium of the European Network of the FAO on the forages (Montpellier, France, 1987)\nXVIIth International Grassland Congress (Palmerston North, New Zealand 1993)\nSymposium of the European Network of the Food and Agriculture Organizationon forages (Chania, Greece, 1993)\nVth International Congress on forages (Salt Lake City, USA, 1995)\nSymposium of the Italian Association of forests and the Italian Minister of Agriculture (Verona, Italy, 1996)\nVIth International Congress on forages (Townsville, Australia, 1999)\nFive international conferences on viticulture and viniculture organized by world\'s largest grapevine nursery Vivai Cooperativi Rauscedo during the (1997\xe2\x80\x932007) period (two in Italy, one in Bordeaux, France, one in Athens, Greece, and one in Porto, Portugal)\n\nMemberships\nShundi was Albanian representative of the European Federation for Forage Plants during the 1995\xe2\x80\x931999 period, a board member of the TEMPUS project for Albania, organized by the EU during the 1991\xe2\x80\x931992 period.
