b'Angolan cuisine is the cuisine of Angola, a country in south central Africa. Because Angola was a Portuguese colony for centuries, Portuguese cuisine has significantly influenced Angolan cuisine, with many foods being imported from Portugal.\n\nIngredients\nStaple ingredients include beans and rice, pork and chicken, various sauces, and vegetables such as tomatoes, onions. Spices such as garlic are also frequently seen.\n\nDishes\nFunge (or funje, Portuguese pronunciation: [\xcb\x88f\xc5\xa9\xca\x92\xc9\xa8\xcc\xa5]) and pir\xc3\xa3o ([pi\xcb\x88\xc9\xbe\xc9\x90\xcc\x83w]) are very common dishes, and in poorer households often consumed at every meal. The dish is often eaten with fish, pork, chicken, or beans. Funge de bombo ([d\xc9\xa8 \xcb\x88b\xc3\xb5bu]), more common in northern Angola, is a paste or porridge of cassava (also called manioc or yuca), made from cassava flour. It is gelatinous in consistency and gray in color. Pir\xc3\xa3o, yellow in color and similar to polenta, is made from cornflour and is more common in the south. Fuba ([fu\xcb\x88ba]) is the term for the flour that is used to make either funge and pir\xc3\xa3o, also used to make angu, the Brazilian polenta. Both foods are described as bland but filling and are often eaten with sauces and juices or with gindungo (see below), a spicy condiment.Muamba de galinha (or chicken moamba, [\xcb\x88mw\xc9\x90\xcc\x83ba d\xc9\xa8 \xc9\xa1\xc9\x90\xcb\x88\xc9\xab\xc4\xa9\xc9\xb2\xc9\x90]) is chicken with palm paste, okra, garlic and palm oil hash or red palm oil sauce, often served with rice and funge. Both funge and moamba de galinha have been considered the national dish. A variant dish of moamba de galinha, muamba de ginguba, uses ginguba ([\xca\x92\xc4\xa9\xcb\x88\xc9\xa1ub\xc9\x90], peanut sauce) instead of palm paste.\n\nList of dishes\nOther dishes common in Angolan cuisine include:\n\nArroz (rice) dishes, including arroz da Ilha (rice with chicken or fish), arroz de garoupa da Ilha ([\xc9\x90\xcb\x88\xca\x81o\xca\x91 d\xc9\xa8 \xc9\xa1\xc9\x90\xcb\x88\xc9\xbeo(w)p\xc9\x90 d\xc9\x90 \xcb\x88i\xca\x8e\xc9\x90], (rice with grouper), and arroz de marisco ([m\xc9\x90\xcb\x88\xc9\xbei\xc9\x95ku], white rice with seafood, typically prawns, squid, white fish, or lobster).\nCabidela (Portuguese pronunciation: [k\xc9\x90bi\xcb\x88\xc3\xb0\xc9\x9b\xc9\xab\xc9\x90]), a dish cooked in blood, served with rice and funge.
