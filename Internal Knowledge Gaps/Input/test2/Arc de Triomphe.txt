b'The Arc de Triomphe de l\'\xc3\x89toile (UK: , US: , French: [a\xca\x81k d\xc9\x99 t\xca\x81ij\xc9\x94\xcc\x83f d\xc9\x99 letwal] (listen); lit.\xe2\x80\x89"Triumphal Arch of the Star") is one of the most famous monuments in Paris, France, standing at the western end of the Champs-\xc3\x89lys\xc3\xa9es at the centre of Place Charles de Gaulle, formerly named Place de l\'\xc3\x89toile\xe2\x80\x94the \xc3\xa9toile or "star" of the juncture formed by its twelve radiating avenues. The location of the arc and the plaza is shared between three arrondissements, 16th (south and west), 17th (north) and 8th (east). The Arc de Triomphe honours those who fought and died for France in the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, with the names of all French victories and generals inscribed on its inner and outer surfaces. Beneath its vault lies the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier from World War I.\nAs the central cohesive element of the Axe historique (historic axis, a sequence of monuments and grand thoroughfares on a route running from the courtyard of the Louvre to the Grande Arche de la D\xc3\xa9fense), the Arc de Triomphe was designed by Jean Chalgrin in 1806; its iconographic programme pits heroically nude French youths against bearded Germanic warriors in chain mail. It set the tone for public monuments with triumphant patriotic messages. Inspired by the Arch of Titus in Rome, Italy, the Arc de Triomphe has an overall height of 50 metres (164 ft), width of 45 m (148 ft) and depth of 22 m (72 ft), while its large vault is 29.19 m (95.8 ft) high and 14.62 m (48.0 ft) wide. The smaller transverse vaults are 18.68 m (61.3 ft) high and 8.44 m (27.7 ft) wide. Three weeks after the Paris victory parade in 1919 (marking the end of hostilities in World War I), Charles Godefroy flew his Nieuport biplane under the arch\'s primary vault, with the event captured on newsreel.Paris\'s Arc de Triomphe was the tallest triumphal arch until the completion of the Monumento a la Revoluci\xc3\xb3n in Mexico City in 1938, which is 67 metres (220 ft) high. The Arch of Triumph in Pyongyang, completed in 1982, is modelled on the Arc de Triomphe and is slightly taller at 60 m (197 ft). La Grande Arche in La Defense near Paris is 110 metres high. Although it is not named an Arc de Triomphe, it has been designed on the same model and in the perspective of the Arc de Triomphe. It qualifies as the world\'s tallest arch.\n\nHistory\nConstruction and late 19th century\nThe Arc de Triomphe is located on the right bank of the Seine at the centre of a dodecagonal configuration of twelve radiating avenues. It was commissioned in 1806 after the victory at Austerlitz by Emperor Napoleon at the peak of his fortunes. Laying the foundations alone took two years and, in 1810, when Napoleon entered Paris from the west with his bride Archduchess Marie-Louise of Austria, he had a wooden mock-up of the completed arch constructed. The architect, Jean Chalgrin, died in 1811 and the work was taken over by Jean-Nicolas Huyot.\n\nDuring the Bourbon Restoration, construction was halted and it would not be completed until the reign of King Louis-Philippe, between 1833 and 1836, by the architects Goust, then Huyot, under the direction of H\xc3\xa9ricart de Thury. On 15 December 1840, brought back to France from Saint Helena, Napoleon\'s remains passed under it on their way to the Emperor\'s final resting place at the Invalides. Prior to burial in the Panth\xc3\xa9on, the body of Victor Hugo was displayed under the Arc during the night of 22 May 1885.\n\n20th century\nThe sword carried by the Republic in the Marseillaise relief broke off on the day, it is said, that the Battle of Verdun began in 1916. The relief was immediately hidden by tarpaulins to conceal the accident and avoid any undesired ominous interpretations. On 7 August 1919, Charles Godefroy successfully flew his biplane under the Arc. Jean Navarre was the pilot who was tasked to make the flight, but he died on 10 July 1919 when he crashed near Villacoublay while training for the flight.\nFollowing its construction, the Arc de Triomphe became the rallying point of French troops parading after successful military campaigns and for the annual Bastille Day military parade. Famous victory marches around or under the Arc have included the Germans in 1871, the French in 1919, the Germans in 1940, and the French and Allies in 1944 and 1945. A United States postage stamp of 1945 shows the Arc de Triomphe in the background as victorious American troops march down the Champs-\xc3\x89lys\xc3\xa9es and U.S. airplanes fly overhead on 29 August 1944. After the interment of the Unknown Soldier, however, all military parades (including the aforementioned post-1919) have avoided marching through the actual arch. The route taken is up to the arch and then around its side, out of respect for the tomb and its symbolism. Both Hitler in 1940 and de Gaulle in 1944 observed this custom.\nBy the early 1960s, the monument had grown very blackened from coal soot and automobile exhaust, and during 1965\xe2\x80\x931966 it was cleaned through bleaching. In the prolongation of the Avenue des Champs-\xc3\x89lys\xc3\xa9es, a new arch, the Grande Arche de la D\xc3\xa9fense, was built in 1982, completing the line of monuments that forms Paris\'s Axe historique. After the Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel and the Arc de Triomphe de l\'\xc3\x89toile, the Grande Arche is the third arch built on the same perspective.\nIn 1995, the Armed Islamic Group of Algeria placed a bomb near the Arc de Triomphe which wounded 17 people as part of a campaign of bombings.\n\n21st century\nIn late 2018, the Arc de Triomphe suffered acts of vandalism as part of the Yellow vests movement protests.\n\nDesign\nMonument\nThe astylar design is by Jean Chalgrin (1739\xe2\x80\x931811), in the Neoclassical version of ancient Roman architecture. Major academic sculptors of France are represented in the sculpture of the Arc de Triomphe: Jean-Pierre Cortot; Fran\xc3\xa7ois Rude; Antoine \xc3\x89tex; James Pradier and Philippe Joseph Henri Lemaire. The main sculptures are not integral friezes but are treated as independent trophies applied to the vast ashlar masonry masses, not unlike the gilt-bronze appliqu\xc3\xa9s on Empire furniture. The four sculptural groups at the base of the Arc are The Triumph of 1810 (Cortot), Resistance and Peace (both by Antoine \xc3\x89tex) and the most renowned of them all, Departure of the Volunteers of 1792 commonly called La Marseillaise (Fran\xc3\xa7ois Rude). The face of the allegorical representation of France calling forth her people on this last was used as the belt buckle for the honorary rank of Marshal of France. Since the fall of Napoleon (1815), the sculpture representing Peace is interpreted as commemorating the Peace of 1815.\nIn the attic above the richly sculptured frieze of soldiers are 30 shields engraved with the names of major French victories in the French Revolution and Napoleonic wars. The inside walls of the monument list the names of 660 people, among which are 558 French generals of the First French Empire; The names of those generals killed in battle are underlined. Also inscribed, on the shorter sides of the four supporting columns, are the names of the major French victories in the Napoleonic Wars. The battles that took place in the period between the departure of Napoleon from Elba to his final defeat at Waterloo are not included.\nFor four years from 1882 to 1886, a monumental sculpture by Alexandre Falgui\xc3\xa8re topped the arch.  Titled Le triomphe de la R\xc3\xa9volution ("The Triumph of the Revolution"), it depicted a chariot drawn by horses preparing "to crush Anarchy and Despotism". It remained there only four years before falling in ruins.\nInside the monument, a permanent exhibition conceived by the artist Maurice Benayoun and the architect Christophe Girault opened in February 2007. The steel and new media installation interrogates the symbolism of the national monument, questioning the balance of its symbolic message during the last two centuries, oscillating between war and peace.\n\nTomb of the Unknown Soldier\nBeneath the Arc is the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier from World War I. Interred on Armistice Day 1920, it has the first eternal flame lit in Western and Eastern Europe since the Vestal Virgins\' fire was extinguished in the fourth century. It burns in memory of the dead who were never identified (now in both world wars).\nA ceremony is held at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier every 11 November on the anniversary of the Armistice of 11 November 1918 signed by the Entente Powers and Germany in 1918. It was originally decided on 12 November 1919 to bury the unknown soldier\'s remains in the Panth\xc3\xa9on, but a public letter-writing campaign led to the decision to bury him beneath the Arc de Triomphe. The coffin was put in the chapel on the first floor of the Arc on 10 November 1920, and put in its final resting place on 28 January 1921. The slab on top bears the inscription ICI REPOSE UN SOLDAT FRAN\xc3\x87AIS MORT POUR LA PATRIE 1914\xe2\x80\x931918 ("Here lies a French soldier who died for the fatherland 1914\xe2\x80\x931918").\nIn 1961, U.S. President John F. Kennedy and First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy paid their respects at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, accompanied by President Charles de Gaulle. After the 1963 assassination of President Kennedy, Mrs Kennedy remembered the eternal flame at the Arc de Triomphe and requested that an eternal flame be placed next to her husband\'s grave at Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia. President Charles de Gaulle went to Washington to attend the state funeral, and witnessed Jacqueline Kennedy lighting the eternal flame that had been inspired by her visit to France.\n\nDetails\nThe four main sculptural groups on each of the Arc\'s pillars are:\nLe D\xc3\xa9part de 1792 (or La Marseillaise), by Fran\xc3\xa7ois Rude. The sculptural group celebrates the cause of the French First Republic during the 10 August uprising. Above the volunteers is the winged personification of Liberty. This group served as a recruitment tool in the early months of World War I and encouraged the French to invest in war loans in 1915\xe2\x80\x931916.\nLe Triomphe de 1810, by Jean-Pierre Cortot celebrates the Treaty of Sch\xc3\xb6nbrunn. This group features Napoleon, crowned by the goddess of Victory.\nLa R\xc3\xa9sistance de 1814, by Antoine \xc3\x89tex commemorates the French Resistance to the Allied Armies during the War of the Sixth Coalition.\nLa Paix de 1815, by Antoine \xc3\x89tex commemorates the Treaty of Paris, concluded in that year.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nSix reliefs sculpted on the fa\xc3\xa7ades of the Arch, representing important moments of the French Revolution and of the Napoleonic era include:\nLes fun\xc3\xa9railles du g\xc3\xa9n\xc3\xa9ral Marceau (General Marceau\'s burial), by P. H. Lamaire (SOUTH fa\xc3\xa7ade, right),\nLa bataille d\'Aboukir (The Battle of Aboukir), by Bernard Seurre (SOUTH fa\xc3\xa7ade, left),\nLa bataille de Jemappes (The Battle of Jemappes), by Carlo Marochetti (EAST fa\xc3\xa7ade),\nLe passage du pont d\'Arcole (The Battle of Arcole), by J. J. Feuch\xc3\xa8re (NORTH fa\xc3\xa7ade, right),\nLa prise d\'Alexandrie, (The Fall of Alexandria), by J. E. Chaponni\xc3\xa8re (NORTH fa\xc3\xa7ade, left),\nLa bataille d\'Austerlitz (The Battle of Austerlitz), by J. F. T. Gechter (WEST fa\xc3\xa7ade),\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nThe names of some great battles of the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars are engraved on the attic, including\nA list of French victories is engraved under the great arches on the inside fa\xc3\xa7ades of the monument.\nOn the inner fa\xc3\xa7ades of the small arches are engraved the names of the military leaders of the French Revolution and Empire. The names of those who died on the battlefield are underlined.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nThe great arcades are decorated with allegorical figures representing characters in Roman mythology (by J. Pradier).\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nThe ceiling with 21 sculpted roses\nInterior of the Arc de Triomphe\n\t\t\nThere are several plaques at the foot of the monument\n\nAccess\nThe Arc de Triomphe is accessible by the RER and M\xc3\xa9tro, with exit at the Charles de Gaulle\xe2\x80\x94\xc3\x89toile station.  Because of heavy traffic on the roundabout of which the Arc is the centre, it is recommended that pedestrians use one of two underpasses located at the Champs \xc3\x89lys\xc3\xa9es and the Avenue de la Grande Arm\xc3\xa9e.  A lift will take visitors almost to the top \xe2\x80\x93 to the attic, where there is a small museum which contains large models of the Arc and tells its story from the time of its construction. Another 40 steps remain to climb in order to reach the top, the terrasse, from where one can enjoy a panoramic view of Paris.The location of the arc, as well as the Place de l\'\xc3\x89toile, is shared between three arrondissements, 16th (south and west), 17th (north), and 8th (east).\n\nSee also\nRomanian Arcul de Triumf\nBastille Day military parade\nGalerie des Batailles\nList of works by James Pradier\nNames inscribed under the Arc de Triomphe\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nInscriptions on the Arc de Triomphe\nClarification of history of Arc de Triomphe\nThe permanent exhibition inside the Arc de Triomphe\nView from the Arc de Triomphe'
