b'Canadian Forces Base Trenton (IATA: YTR, ICAO: CYTR) (also CFB Trenton), formerly RCAF Station Trenton, is a Canadian Forces base located within the city  of Quinte West, Ontario. It is operated as an air force base by the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) and is the hub for air transport operations in Canada and abroad. Its primary RCAF lodger unit is 8 Wing, commonly referred to as 8 Wing Trenton.  CFB Trenton is Canada\'s largest Air Force base.\nThe airport is classified as an airport of entry by Nav Canada and is staffed by the Canada Border Services Agency. The use of the airport for civilian aircraft is permitted for emergencies or MEDEVACs only and the CBSA officers can only handle general aviation aircraft with up to 15 passengers.\n\nHistory\n1929\xe2\x80\x931939 Prewar\nIn 1929, 960 acres (390 ha) of farmland near Trenton were purchased by the federal government to establish a Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) station to be called RCAF Station Trenton. The base was officially opened in August 1931. Lord Bessborough, the Governor General in 1931, laid the commemorative cornerstone of the airbase, which had the motto, "Per Ardua ad Rem," or "Through Adversity to the Good" . This motto was the long-standing unspoken motto of the airmen of CFB Trenton. Trenton was intended as a smaller supporting base to RCAF Station Borden, which was the home of Canadian military aviation and a major training base at the time. By June 1937 it had replaced Camp Borden as the primary flying training centre; the older station was given over increasingly to technical and trades training. The location was chosen for being the midpoint between Ottawa and Toronto. It also provided the possibility of using the facility for seaplanes operating on Lake Ontario.\n\n1939\xe2\x80\x931945 World War II\nNo. 1 Fighter and No. 3 Army Cooperation Flights, flying Siskin and Tiger Moth aircraft, were the first air elements to be hosted at Trenton. Trenton was the largest training centre of the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan (BCATP) during the Second World War. Schools included the RCAF Central Flying School, No. 1 Air Navigation School (to 1942), No. 1 Flying Instructor School, and No. 1 Composite Training School. Along with the training schools, the No. 6 Repair Depot was based at Trenton.  During the war the relief landing field for Trenton was located at Mohawk.\n\nHistorical aerodrome information\nIn approximately 1942 the aerodrome was listed as RCAF Aerodrome - Trenton, Ontario at 44\xc2\xb007\xe2\x80\xb2N 77\xc2\xb032\xe2\x80\xb2W with a variation of 12 degrees west and elevation of 240 ft (73 m).  The field was listed as "All hard surfaced" and detailed four runways as follows:\n\n1945\xe2\x80\x931990 Cold War\nFollowing the war, Trenton became home to transport and fighter aircraft, with transport aircraft from the base taking part in the Korean Airlift, as well as numerous other missions throughout the 1950s and 1960s.\nOn February 2, 1959, RCAF Station Trenton became the destination for CF-105 Arrow 25204, flying from the Avro Canada manufacturing facility at Malton Airport. A Trans-Canada Air Lines Vickers Viscount had crash landed during 25204\'s flight, temporarily closing the runways at Malton.Canada upgraded its transport and search and rescue fleets during the 1960s when the RCAF purchased the CC-137 Husky, CC-130 Hercules, CH-113 Labrador and CC-115 Buffalo aircraft. RCAF Station Trenton became the home of training facilities for these aircraft.\nRCAF Station Trenton was renamed Canadian Forces Base (CFB) Trenton after the February 1, 1968 merger of the RCAF with the Royal Canadian Navy and Canadian Army to form the Canadian Forces.\n\n21st century\nArrest and conviction of former base commander\nCFB Trenton\'s former commander, David Russell Williams, was arrested in 2009, and convicted of serial rape and murder in 2010; some of his crimes were committed while in command of the base.\n\nUse as a quarantine facility for COVID-19\nDue to the 2019\xe2\x80\x9320 coronavirus pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 caused by SARS-CoV-2 that originated in Wuhan, China, on February 7, 2020, 215 Canadians (176 from the first plane, and 39 from a second plane chartered by the U.S. government) were repatriated from Wuhan, and brought to CFB Trenton to be quarantined for two weeks. On February 11, another plane of repatriated Canadians (185) from Wuhan landed at CFB Trenton. On February 21, a chartered flight of 131 Canadians who were quarantined on the Diamond Princess after an outbreak on the cruise ship in Japan, and who all tested negative for the virus, were brought to CFB Trenton for additional screening before being transported by bus to NAV Centre in Cornwall, Ontario to be quarantined. On March 10, a chartered flight of 228 Canadians who were on the Grand Princess after an outbreak on the cruise ship in California, and who all did not test positive for the virus, were brought to CFB Trenton for a 14-day quarantine period. As of March 20, 12 positive cases for the virus of the repatriated citizens at CFB Trenton have been reported.\n\nFacilities\nHeritage buildings\nCFB Trenton has several recognized and classified Federal Heritage buildings on the Register of the Government of Canada Heritage Buildings.\nAdministration Building 29 Recognized \xe2\x80\x93 1995\nHangars 3 Buildings 51; 5 Building 49 Recognized \xe2\x80\x93 1991\nHangars 9 B112; 10 B52 Recognized \xe2\x80\x93 2004\nHastings Hall / Officer\'s Quarters, Building 111 Recognized \xe2\x80\x93 1995\nHeadquarters Buildings 22 & 23 Recognized \xe2\x80\x93 1995\nJunior Quarters, Buildings 21 & 56 Recognized \xe2\x80\x93 1995\nOfficer\'s Mess Building 38 Recognized \xe2\x80\x93 1995\nVIP Private Married Quarters Building 42 Recognized \xe2\x80\x93 1995\n\nCurrent\nThe recapitalization of the northeast ramp was completed in summer 2008, and reconstruction of the southeast ramp was completed in the summer of 2009.Construction of a new air traffic control tower was completed in July 2010.The Canadian Forces Aerospace Warfare Centre is housed in a new building named after Air Marshal Clare Annis.

ATESS provides specialized engineering, training, and production/manufacturing in aerospace and telecommunications. Its capabilities encompass avionics, non-destructive testing (NDT), integrated health monitoring (IHM/HUMS), aircraft structures and more. CFAWC is the centre of excellence for air power development, including Concept Development and Experimentation (CD&E) and lessons learned. In addition, CFAWC develops and maintains the Air Force air power knowledge repository and coordinates efforts to provide advanced synthetic environment and modelling and simulation services to assist CD&E, requirements definition, operational test and evaluation (OT&E) and mission rehearsal. The CFAWC is commanded by an RCAF Colonel.The current commander of the base is Colonel Ryan Deming, who assumed his post July 26, 2019.\n\nQuinte International Air Show\nIn 2016, the former base commander, Colonel Colin Keiver and Chief Warrant Officer Darcy Elder, had recreated the Quinte International Air Show which had not been held since 2003. There had been plans for the air show to be held biennially.  There had been no air show in 2018. Mark Goulden, the commander at the time of the cancellation, stated "Operations at 8 Wing Trenton is our priority, whether it be helping Canadians during disasters such as the British Columbia wildfires, delivering humanitarian aid internationally, or supplying Canadian Armed Forces missions around the world. It is with these operational commitments in mind that 8 Wing Trenton has made the difficult decision to cancel the 2018 Quinte International Air Show."\n\nQuinte International Air Show 2016\nThe 2016 air show attracted close to 80,000 visitors. The theme for that year was the commemoration of the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan (BCATP) with it being the 75th Anniversary since the BCATP had commenced.  Aircraft from multiple Air Forces around the world attended including the United States Air Force, Royal Air Force and Mexican Air Force.Some of the aircraft performing at the air show included:\n\nBoeing B-52 Stratofortress,\nAvro Lancaster,\nInterstate Cadet,\nLockheed C-130 Hercules,\nLockheed Martin F-22 Raptor,\nMcDonnell Douglas CF-18 Hornet,\nNorth American B-25 Mitchell,\nNorth American P-51 Mustang,\nNorth American T-6 Texan,\nSnowbirds,\nYakovlev Yak-52 and many more aircraft parked on the ramp.\n\nOther operations\nThe National Air Force Museum of Canada is on the base.\nMountain View Detachment, a former World War II RCAF airfield located south of Belleville, is utilized as a storage and overhaul facility of older aircraft.
