b'Uarbryichthys ("Uarbry Fish") is a genus of primitive teleost ray-finned fish from fossil beds near the Talbragar River Bed.  The various species were lake-dwelling fish that lived during the Upper Jurassic of Australia, and are closely related to the macrosemiids.  The living animal would have had a superficial resemblance to a very small porgie, or sea bream, but with a heterocercal tail fin.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nPaleobiology Database Entry'
